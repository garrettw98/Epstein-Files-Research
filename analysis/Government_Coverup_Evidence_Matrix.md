# Government Cover-Up Evidence Matrix

> **Scope**: Distinguish documented institutional failures from allegations and unresolved questions.
> **Updated**: February 14, 2026
> **Important**: "Cover-up" is often used broadly. This matrix separates what is proven from what is currently inferential.

## Status Key

- **Documented**: Supported by primary documents and official records.
- **Credible allegation**: Public allegation by officials/witnesses, not yet fully corroborated in primary records.
- **Unresolved**: Open question with mixed or insufficient evidence.

## Practical Research Rules

- Treat **process failures** and **intentional protection** as different claims.
- Require at least one Tier 1 source before labeling any claim "proven."
- Keep "alleged cover-up" language tied to named speakers or documents.
- Revisit unresolved items whenever new court filings or OIG/Congress records appear.
