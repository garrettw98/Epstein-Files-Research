# Remaining Topics and Scandals Backlog (Feb 18, 2026)

This backlog identifies likely coverage gaps after comparing current `topics/`, `profiles/`, timeline/evidence updates, and claim-quality review outputs.

## Scope Used
- `topics/` and `profiles/` current inventory.
- `README.md` live updates and `timeline/Full_Timeline.md`.
- `evidence/2026_Release.md` and `evidence/Primary_Sources_Index.md`.
- `derived/claims/claim_review_queue_latest.tsv` (especially open `p1`/`p2` rows).

## P1: Add These Topic Files First

| Suggested file | Why this is still a gap | Seed anchors already in repo |
|---|---|---|
| `topics/The_Redaction_and_Context_Scandal.md` | Redaction dispute is spread across multiple files, but no single page explains the chronology, standards used, and context problem of name-only disclosures. | `evidence/2026_Release.md` (redaction sections), `topics/The_Epstein_Files_Transparency_Act.md`, `derived/claims/claim_review_queue_latest.tsv` (`claim-doj-letter-300plus-no-context`, `claim-doj-redactions-letter-reuters`) |
| `topics/The_DOJ_Search_Logging_Controversy.md` | Mentioned as a major event, but no dedicated explainer covering what was logged, oversight concerns, and policy implications. | `README.md` live updates, `evidence/2026_Release.md` (search-logging section), `analysis/Government_Coverup_Evidence_Matrix.md` |
| `topics/The_Zorro_Ranch_Commission.md` | New Mexico commission is currently only a timeline/event note; no standalone tracker for mandate, hearing schedule, scope, and expected outputs. | `README.md` (Feb 17 Reuters item), `timeline/Government_Response_To_Epstein_Files.md`, `analysis/New_Developments_Feb_17_2026.md` |
| `topics/The_Co_Conspirator_Designation_Process.md` | The repo names co-conspirators but lacks one page explaining designation source documents, legal meaning, and what designation does/does not prove. | `evidence/2026_Release.md` (unredaction/co-conspirator sections), `profiles/Les_Wexner.md`, `profiles/Jean_Luc_Brunel.md`, `profiles/Lesley_Groff.md` |
| `topics/The_CVRA_Litigation_Path.md` | CVRA appears in multiple places but has no dedicated timeline of filing, ruling, and practical limits for victims. | `topics/The_Plea_Deal.md`, `profiles/Courtney_Wild.md`, `topics/Legal_Battles.md` |
| `topics/The_MCC_Guard_Case.md` | Jail guard falsified-records case is referenced, but no single case file tracks charges, outcomes, and relation to OIG findings. | `timeline/Government_Response_To_Epstein_Files.md`, `topics/Deep_Dive_The_Death.md`, `evidence/Primary_Sources_Index.md` |

## P2: Missing Profiles Worth Adding

| Suggested file | Why add it |
|---|---|
| `profiles/Pam_Bondi.md` | Central to release policy, hearing testimony, and redaction/search-logging disputes; currently appears in timeline/evidence without a dedicated profile. |
| `profiles/Todd_Blanche.md` | Repeatedly appears in 2026 release/redaction narrative but has no profile. |
| `profiles/Thomas_Massie.md` | Directly shaped unredaction events and congressional pressure sequence; no standalone file. |
| `profiles/Ro_Khanna.md` | Co-led transparency push and floor disclosure actions; no standalone file. |
| `profiles/Casey_Wasserman.md` | Repeatedly appears in claim queue and live updates; no profile. |
| `profiles/Alexander_Acosta.md` | Core historical actor in the NPA era but still only distributed references. |
| `profiles/Michael_Reiter.md` | Palm Beach investigative lead; useful for local-vs-federal enforcement chronology. |
| `profiles/Nicholas_Tartaglione.md` | Relevant to July 23/early custody timeline; currently only embedded in incident/death topics. |

## P3: High-Value Expansion Topics (Already Mentioned, Not Fully Developed)

| Suggested file | Why this matters |
|---|---|
| `topics/The_Visa_Factory_Channel.md` | Converts the State/visa strand from `COLD_CASES.md` into a sourced operational pipeline analysis. |
| `topics/The_Art_Market_Money_Channel.md` | Art-transfer/laundering pathway is flagged but not developed as a structured financial channel topic. |
| `topics/The_1953_Trust_Beneficiary_Blind_Spot.md` | Trust is heavily referenced, but beneficiary opacity lacks a dedicated legal/forensic explainer. |
| `topics/The_Encrypted_Drives_and_Server_Scrub.md` | Evidence-destruction and inaccessible data questions are scattered; needs one forensic timeline file. |
| `topics/The_Source_Provenance_Chain.md` | Add a methodology page for provenance and confidence to reduce name-only implication risk and keep claims auditable. |

## Immediate Claim-Quality Backlog (Should Be Resolved in Parallel)

Open queue rows currently point to specific narrative gaps:
- `claim-doj-letter-300plus-no-context` (`p1`)
- `claim-doj-redactions-letter-reuters` (`p1`)
- `claim-epstein-nobel-outreach-ap` (`p2`)
- `claim-lifetouch-school-cancellations` (`p2`)
- `claim-lutnick-meetings-acknowledged-ap` (`p2`)
- `claim-wasserman-agency-sale` (`p2`)

These should be neutral-framed and connected to stronger primary evidence before promotion.

## Recommended Build Order (Fastest Impact)

1. `topics/The_Redaction_and_Context_Scandal.md`
2. `topics/The_DOJ_Search_Logging_Controversy.md`
3. `profiles/Pam_Bondi.md`
4. `profiles/Todd_Blanche.md`
5. `topics/The_Co_Conspirator_Designation_Process.md`
6. `topics/The_MCC_Guard_Case.md`
7. `topics/The_CVRA_Litigation_Path.md`
8. `topics/The_Zorro_Ranch_Commission.md`
9. `profiles/Thomas_Massie.md`
10. `profiles/Ro_Khanna.md`

## Second-Wave Additions (Beyond First Pass)

These are additional high-value gaps after adding the first three process topics and five key profiles.

## P1 Topic Candidates (Process + Evidence Integrity)

| Suggested file | Why this adds value |
|---|---|
| `topics/The_DOJ_300_Name_Letter.md` | Standalone explainer for the Feb 2026 300+ names letter, context limitations, and interpretation risks. |
| `topics/The_FBI_Prominent_Names_Presentation.md` | Dedicated analysis of the 21-slide FBI "prominent names" deck cited in release files. |
| `topics/The_Secure_Reading_Room_Protocol.md` | Clarifies access rules, unredacted-review mechanics, and oversight constraints. |
| `topics/The_Speech_or_Debate_Clause_Playbook.md` | Legal/procedural explainer for floor disclosures and protection limits. |
| `topics/The_FBI_Scrubbing_Allegation_Evidence_Chain.md` | Tracks allegation chronology and required proof chain without overclaiming intent. |
| `topics/The_Victim_Exposure_Redaction_Failures.md` | Isolates victim-privacy failures, remediation steps, and unresolved harm questions. |
| `topics/The_No_Client_List_Finding_and_Its_Limits.md` | Separates AP-reported finding from broader coercion/kompromat theories. |

## P2 Topic Candidates (Fallout + Governance)

| Suggested file | Why this adds value |
|---|---|
| `topics/The_Corporate_Fallout_Tracker_2026.md` | Consolidates resignations/step-downs and governance actions across firms. |
| `topics/The_LA28_Wasserman_Fallout.md` | Separates LA28 governance fallout from generic profile coverage. |
| `topics/The_Lifetouch_School_Panic_Case.md` | Case study of viral allegation spread vs verified evidence handling. |
| `topics/The_DP_World_Succession_Fallout.md` | Consolidates bin Sulayem resignation and interim leadership consequences. |
| `topics/The_Nobel_Network_Outreach_Disclosures.md` | Focused treatment of Nobel-outreach thread currently dispersed across files. |

## Additional Profile Candidates

| Suggested file | Why this adds value |
|---|---|
| `profiles/Alexander_Acosta.md` | Core plea-era decision maker still lacking a dedicated profile. |
| `profiles/Nicholas_Tartaglione.md` | Cellmate role in July 23 incident and custody timeline deserves standalone treatment. |
| `profiles/Cynthia_Lummis.md` | Public stance reversal after secure-room review is repeatedly cited. |
| `profiles/Summer_Lee.md` | Bondi contempt amendment role anchors a key Jan 2026 oversight event. |
| `profiles/Mike_Johnson.md` | Speaker role in DOJ search-logging dispute and congressional response. |
| `profiles/Jamie_Raskin.md` | Recurrent oversight figure in hearing and subpoena-conflict context. |
| `profiles/Tova_Noel.md` | Guard charged in custody-record falsification case. |
| `profiles/Michael_Thomas.md` | Guard charged in custody-record falsification case. |
| `profiles/Efrain_Reyes.md` | Cellmate-transfer sequence is central to death-custody process timeline. |
| `profiles/Mona_Juul.md` | Repeatedly appears in Norway scandal/international fallout chronology. |

## Data/Method Additions (Non-Narrative but High Impact)

1. Add a `name_context_class` field to claim records (`direct_contact`, `administrative_mention`, `media_reference`, `unverified_allegation`) to reduce implication drift.
2. Add a `primary_evidence_gap_register.md` report listing all `verified_secondary` claims lacking Tier-1 links.
3. Expand primary-document ingest targets to include additional docket-level records tied to open `p2` claims.
4. Add a formal redaction taxonomy table (`victim_privacy`, `ongoing_investigation`, `national_security`, `unknown`) for dispute tracking.
