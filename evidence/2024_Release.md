# 📂 The January 2024 Document Release

> **Summary**: In early 2024, a judge ordered the unsealing of ~900 pages of documents from a settled civil lawsuit (*Giuffre v. Maxwell*).

## What Was Revealed?
Most of the information confirmed what researchers already knew, but it provided more detail:
*   **Prince Andrew**: Testimony confirmed the "puppet photo" incident (groping allegation).
*   **Bill Clinton**: Mentioned in depositions. One witness said Epstein claimed, "Clinton likes them young," though Clinton has denied any misconduct.
*   **David Copperfield**: A witness described him doing magic tricks at dinner and asking if she knew "girls were paid to find other girls."

## The "Viral Name" Debunking
The internet exploded with misinformation when this list came out. Here is the verified context for the most viral names:

| Name | The Rumor | The Truth (From the Docs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stephen Hawking** | "He was at an orgy." | **FALSE.** Epstein wrote an email offering money to *disprove* this false rumor. |
| **Michael Jackson** | "He was a client." | **FALSE.** A witness said she met him but explicitly testified: "I did not give him a massage." |
| **Donald Trump** | "He was on the island." | **FALSE.** A witness specifically testified she **never** saw Trump on the island. |
| **Al Gore** | "He was involved." | **FALSE.** Named in a list of "VIPs" to look out for, but witnesses never saw him. |

## Why Were These Released?
These were exhibits in a 2015 defamation case. They were sealed to protect the privacy of "Jane Does" and third parties. The judge ruled that since most names were already public, there was no reason to keep them hidden.
