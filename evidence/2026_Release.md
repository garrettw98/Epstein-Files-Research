## Pre-Release: Bloomberg Email Investigation (September 2025)

Before the DOJ releases, **Bloomberg News** independently obtained approximately **18,700 emails** from one of Epstein's personal Yahoo accounts, spanning 2002-2022:

- Cryptographic verification, metadata analysis, and corroboration confirmed authenticity
- Four independent experts reviewed the methodology
- Emails mostly exchanged between **2005 and 2008**
- Revealed that Maxwell and Epstein exchanged **at least 650 emails** — about **203 messages** in the first six months of 2008, undercutting Maxwell's claims that her connection had diminished
- Federal prosecutors had opened a **financial-crimes investigation** in 2007, including potential **money laundering** charges
- Crisis strategist **Merrie Spaeth** (former Reagan administration) coached Epstein on communication, including how to answer questions **"without being trapped by the parameters"**

## The December 2025 Initial Release

### What Was Released
The DOJ released an initial batch on **December 19, 2025** (the 30-day deadline):
- Led to **bipartisan criticism** as inadequate
- **Over 550 pages** were **entirely blacked out** (CBS News count)
- One series of three consecutive documents (255 pages) was fully redacted
- A 119-page document labeled "Grand Jury-NY" was entirely redacted
- At least 180 additional pages were mostly but not entirely redacted

### The Disappeared Files
Less than a day after the release, **at least 16 files disappeared** from the DOJ webpage without explanation:
- Included **File 468** — a photo of Trump, Melania, Epstein, and Maxwell from a desk drawer
- DOJ later stated: *"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department temporarily removed the image for further review"*
- The photo was eventually reposted without alteration

### The "Soft Redaction" Disaster
The most talked-about failure: **simply copying and pasting** from the PDF revealed hidden text:
- Black boxes were cosmetic, not permanent redactions
- Underlying data remained intact
- Millions downloaded unredacted versions before fixes
- Duplicate copies of the same documents appeared with **different levels of redactions**
- The same PowerPoint appeared **six times** with different information blocked in each version

### Criticism
Rep. **Thomas Massie** (R-KY), co-sponsor of the Act:
> *"This release grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law."*

Survivor **Annie Farmer**:
> *"There's just no explanation for how it could've been done so poorly."*

### Victim Response

A group of survivors wrote:

## Prosecution Status

### Deputy AG Todd Blanche Statement (Feb 2, 2026)

Speaking on CNN's State of the Union:

> There would be **no additional prosecutions** related to Epstein.

> "There's a lot of correspondence. There's a lot of emails. There's a lot of photographs... [but the materials do not] allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody."

### Implications

- 3 million+ pages deemed insufficient for charges
- Focus shifted to transparency over prosecution
- Victim advocates express disappointment

Separate from DOJ, the House Oversight Committee:
- Subpoenaed Bill and Hillary Clinton
- Held contempt vote after no-shows
- Clintons agreed to testify Feb 26-27, 2026

See: [The Clinton Oversight Investigation](../topics/The_Clinton_Oversight_Investigation.md)

## The Congressional Unredaction Battle (February 9-10, 2026)

### Congressional Review of Unredacted Files (Feb 9)

On **February 9, 2026**, the DOJ for the first time allowed members of Congress to review **unredacted versions** of the Epstein files in a secure reading room at the Justice Department. Members were required to give 24 hours' notice.

Reps. **Thomas Massie** (R-KY) and **Ro Khanna** (D-CA) — the co-authors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act — were among the first to review the files. After approximately **two hours** of review, they announced they had discovered **six men** whose names were "likely incriminated" by their inclusion in the files but had been **redacted** in the public release.

### The Six Redacted Names

Massie described the six individuals:
- At least **one U.S. citizen** and **one foreigner**
- **"Three or four"** others whose nationalities they could not immediately determine
- One individual was **"pretty high up in a foreign government"**
- Another was described as **"a pretty prominent individual"**

### Massie's Live CNN Confrontation (Feb 9)

In a remarkable live television moment, Rep. Massie appeared on CNN with anchor **Kaitlan Collins** and publicly challenged Deputy AG **Todd Blanche** over the redactions:

- Massie referenced a 2009 email where Epstein wrote **"where are you? are you ok, I loved the torture video"** — with the recipient's name redacted
- Massie described the recipient as "a sultan"
- Blanche responded on social media, accusing Massie of **"grandstanding"**
- Blanche then confirmed the recipient was **Sultan Bin Sulayem** (file EFTA00666117)
- Massie also identified a **"well known retired CEO"** whose name was redacted
- Blanche responded by **unredacting Les Wexner's name** from the document, noting Wexner was already mentioned "thousands of times" in the files

### The 20-Person List Unredaction

The confrontation led to the DOJ **unredacting 16 of 18 hidden names** from an unclassified list of 20 individuals:

| Previously Visible | Newly Unredacted | Still Redacted |
|----|----|----|
| Jeffrey Epstein | Les Wexner (co-conspirator) | 2 victim names |
| Ghislaine Maxwell | Lesley Groff (co-conspirator) | |
| | Jean-Luc Brunel (co-conspirator) | |
| | 13 additional names | |

Blanche stated the DOJ had **"just un-redacted all non-victim names"** from the document and insisted the department was **"hiding nothing."**

### Khanna's House Floor Disclosure (Feb 10)

On **February 10, 2026**, Rep. Ro Khanna took to the **House floor** and publicly named all six individuals, protected by the Constitution's **Speech or Debate Clause** (which grants immunity from civil or criminal liability for statements made during official legislative proceedings):

1. **[Salvatore Nuara](../profiles/Salvatore_Nuara.md)** — retired NYPD detective; appeared in Epstein's black book; disciplined for escort service connections
2. **[Zurab Mikeladze](../profiles/Zurab_Mikeladze.md)** — minimal public information available; possibly Georgian nationality
3. **[Leonic Leonov](../profiles/Leonic_Leonov.md)** — minimal public information available; possibly Russian nationality
4. **[Nicola Caputo](../profiles/Nicola_Caputo.md)** — name from document EFTA00077895; identity not fully verified in public reporting
5. **[Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem](../profiles/Sultan_Ahmed_Bin_Sulayem.md)** — CEO of DP World (Dubai); 4,700+ appearances in files; "torture video" email recipient
6. **[Leslie Wexner](../profiles/Les_Wexner.md)** — Victoria's Secret founder; ~200 references; formally designated "co-conspirator" by FBI

Four of the six (Nuara, Mikeladze, Leonov, Caputo) appeared in only **one document** each on the 20-person list. Bin Sulayem and Wexner appeared extensively throughout the files.

On **Feb 11, 2026**, CBS News reported a DOJ spokesperson said those four one-document names do not appear to directly implicate the men in criminal conduct.

### Khanna's Key Quotes

> "70 to 80 percent of the files are still redacted."

> "If we found six men that they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those 3 million files."

> "Why did it take Thomas Massie and me going to the Justice Department to get these six men's identities to become public?"

### FBI Scrubbing Allegation

Khanna made the explosive allegation that **"Donald Trump's FBI scrubbed these files in March"** — months before the Transparency Act was signed into law. He stated that the FBI removed **survivors' statements** naming "rich and powerful men who went to Epstein's island" and who "raped them or committed heinous acts."

The DOJ told Khanna and Massie that they **"just uploaded whatever the FBI sent us"** — suggesting the FBI, not the DOJ, was responsible for the scrubbing.

### Massie's "Nuclear Option" Threat

Massie warned that if the DOJ continued to withhold names, he was prepared to **"go nuclear"** and begin reading Epstein's client names on the House floor himself. He stated:

> "If the victims believe that the best way to get justice is to force the DOJ to release these names," he would invoke the Speech or Debate Clause.

### Senator Lummis Changes Stance (Feb 9)

Sen. **Cynthia Lummis** (R-WY) reversed her previous dismissive position after reviewing the unredacted files:

> "Well, initially, my reaction to all this was, 'I don't care. I don't know what the big deal is.' But now I see what the big deal is, and it was worth investigating."

Lummis was particularly affected by learning about **"9-year-old victims"** in the files. She acknowledged that **"the members of Congress that have been pushing this were not wrong."**

### FBI Internal "Prominent Names" Presentation

A **21-slide FBI presentation**, created sometime after mid-July 2025, was included in the released files. It outlined:
- Various federal investigations into Epstein, his death, and Maxwell
- A list of **"prominent names"** in the investigative files
- FBI employees were asked to compile **"salacious statements"** made about 13 people
- Names on the list included: **President Trump, former President Clinton, Prince Andrew, Harvey Weinstein, Leon Black, Les Wexner, Jes Staley**, and others
- The presentation included newly disclosed but **unverified claims** of sexual assault against Trump, Weinstein, and Black
- It is unclear what steps were taken to verify any of the allegations

### AP Review of Investigative Files (Feb 8)

Associated Press reported that internal FBI/DOJ review material found:
- No evidence investigators found a standalone Epstein **"client list"**
- No evidence of a trafficking operation run specifically **to provide underage girls to powerful men**
- Many allegations in the files remain unproven, disputed, or based on unverified tips

Source: [Associated Press, Feb 8, 2026](https://apnews.com/article/049c96080a2ca2c12c84ac506437e50b)

### AG Bondi Testimony (Held Feb 11)

- Hearing lasted over five hours
- Members from both parties pressed DOJ over file handling, redactions, and release sequencing
- Bondi said she did not order DOJ to monitor congressional searching of the files and defended DOJ's process

Detailed hearing record now stored in:
- **[Bondi Hearing Full Dossier](Bondi_Hearing_Feb_11_2026.md)**
- `derived/bondi_hearing/bondi_hearing_updates_latest.tsv` (23 captured live updates with timestamps and full text)

Major hearing clusters documented in the full dossier:
- **Disclosure governance**: redactions, sequence of release, and whether additional names should be unredacted
- **Investigation posture**: tension between claims of "pending investigations" and earlier statements that no new charges were expected
- **Survivor treatment**: questioning about victim redactions, unredacted victim information, and DOJ outreach
- **Executive-branch ties**: questioning on whether DOJ interviewed senior officials named in the files
- **Portal logging fallout**: hearing statements that set up the next-day dispute about congressional search tracking

### DOJ Search-Logging Dispute (Feb 12)

AP reported DOJ tracked how often lawmakers and staff searched specific terms and names in the file portal:
- Speaker Mike Johnson said he **disapproved** and asked DOJ for information
- Democrats called the practice inappropriate and demanded explanation
- DOJ said the access log was standard portal analytics and denied improper intent

Source: [Associated Press, Feb 12, 2026](https://apnews.com/article/13eeb9ccadcc03ba34922d8ba95ce220)

### Caveat on Four of the Six Publicly Named Men (CBS, Feb 11)

CBS News reported a DOJ spokesperson said four newly publicized names appear once in one file and **"do not appear to directly implicate"** those men in criminal conduct.

Source: [CBS News, Feb 11, 2026](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/massie-khanna-epstein-files-6-men/)
