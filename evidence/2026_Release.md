# 📂 The 2026 "Transparency Act" Release

> **Release Date**: January 30, 2026
> **Volume**: ~3 Million Pages, 2,000 Videos

## Overview
Passed by Congress in late 2025, the "Epstein Files Transparency Act" forced the DOJ to release the remaining stockpiles of evidence seized from Epstein's properties.

## Key New Findings
1.  **Prince Andrew's "Dinner Party"**: Emails reveal he attended an intimate dinner with Epstein **after** Epstein's release from jail. This destroys his defense that he "cut ties" with the financier after the 2008 conviction.
2.  **Steve Bannon**: Videos show hours of interview footage between Bannon and Epstein, with Bannon receiving gifts.
3.  **Peter Mandelson**: The former UK minister is implicated in emails suggesting he shared sensitive government info with Epstein.
4.  **The "Suicide Note" Doubt**: A handwritten note by an investigator in the file observes: *"The note found near the body does not appear to be a suicide note."* This fuels the skepticism surrounding the official suicide ruling.
5.  **Elon Musk**: Emails discuss potential visits, but there is still **no confirmation** he ever went to the island.

## Media
*   **The Videos**: Mostly mundane footage of interviews and property tours, but redacted versions have been released online.
*   **The Photos**: 180,000 images, largely of social events, property interiors, and travel.
