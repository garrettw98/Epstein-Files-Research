## The Redaction Scandal (Expanded)

### What Went Wrong

**The "Soft Redaction" Error**:
- Digital files contained black boxes over text
- Users could **copy-paste** to reveal hidden names
- Millions downloaded unredacted versions before fixes

### Wall Street Journal Investigation

The WSJ found:
- **43+ victims' full names exposed**
- Including **24+ who were minors** when abused
- Some names appeared **100+ times**
- **Home addresses** visible in keyword searches

### Attorney Findings

Attorneys for survivors found:
- **At least 31 people** victimized as children had names exposed
- Information promised to be protected was publicly released

### Victim Response

A group of survivors wrote:
> "This latest release of Jeffrey Epstein files is being sold as transparency, but what it actually does is expose survivors. Once again, survivors are having their names and identifying information exposed, while **the men who abused us remain hidden and protected**."

### Legal Action

**February 1, 2026**: Attorneys representing **200+ alleged victims** asked federal judges to:
- **Immediately shut down** the DOJ Epstein Files website
- Called it *"the single most egregious violation of victim privacy in one day in United States history"*

### DOJ Response

Deputy AG Todd Blanche defended the effort:
> "Think about this though: you're talking about pieces of paper that stack from the ground to **two Eiffel Towers**. The minute that a victim or their lawyer reached out to us since Friday, we immediately dealt with it and pulled it down."

**Reality**: As of February 4, 2026, victims' identities remained accessible despite assurances.

### Nude Image Controversy

The DOJ published **unredacted nude images** showing young women with faces visible:
- Images were largely removed after **New York Times** notification
- Raises questions about review process
- DOJ stated it treated all women in pornographic images as victims

- Installation records for bedroom/bathroom cameras

## Prosecution Status

### Deputy AG Todd Blanche Statement (Feb 2, 2026)

Speaking on CNN's State of the Union:

> There would be **no additional prosecutions** related to Epstein.

> "There's a lot of correspondence. There's a lot of emails. There's a lot of photographs... [but the materials do not] allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody."

### Implications

- **No new arrests expected** from DOJ
- 3 million+ pages deemed insufficient for charges
- Focus shifted to transparency over prosecution
- Victim advocates express disappointment

## The Clinton Investigation

Separate from DOJ, the House Oversight Committee:
- Subpoenaed Bill and Hillary Clinton
- Held contempt vote after no-shows
- Clintons agreed to testify Feb 26-27, 2026

See: [The Clinton Oversight Investigation](../topics/The_Clinton_Oversight_Investigation.md)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Scale**: 3.5 million pages released (half of total)
2. **New Names**: Lutnick, Tisch, Branson, Lajcak among new revelations
3. **Eastern Europe**: Systematic trafficking pipeline documented
4. **Death Questions**: "Orange shape" raises new questions
5. **Redaction Failures**: 43+ victims exposed
6. **No Prosecutions**: DOJ says charges unlikely
7. **International Fallout**: Resignations, investigations across Europe
8. **Russian Connection**: $1.1 billion through sanctioned banks

## Document Warning

The DOJ noted:
> "This production may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos, as everything sent to the FBI by the public was included in the production."
