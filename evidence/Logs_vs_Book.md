# ✈️ Flight Logs vs. 📓 The "Black Book"

One of the biggest sources of confusion on the internet is the difference between the **Flight Logs** and the **Little Black Book**. They are **not** the same thing.

## 1. The Flight Logs (The "Manifests")
*   **What they are**: Official pilot logs recording every flight of Epstein's plane (Boeing 727, tail number N908JE).
*   **What they prove**: **Physical presence**. If someone is on this list, they definitely traveled with Epstein.
*   **Key Names**: Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker, Alan Dershowitz.
*   **Significance**: High. Flying on a private plane implies a closer relationship or specific business purpose.

## 2. The "Little Black Book"
*   **What it is**: An address book seized by the FBI from Epstein's home.
*   **What it proves**: **Contact information**. It lists phone numbers and addresses for over 1,000 people.
*   **Key Names**: Alec Baldwin, Ralph Fiennes, Courtney Love, Michael Bloomberg, Rupert Murdoch.
*   **Significance**: Lower.
    *   Epstein was a "collector" of people. He would get contact info at parties or through friends.
    *   Being in the book **does not** mean the person ever visited the island or flew on the plane.
    *   Many people in the book (like Donald Trump) had 14 different numbers listed, implying Epstein wanted to reach them, not necessarily that they were close friends.
    *   **Cryptic Codes**: The book contains bizarre, unexplained notations like **"Yob HERIOU @POD. CATSTT."** next to certain entries, suggesting a coded language for specific contacts.

## ⚠️ The "Client List" Myth
**There is no single "Client List".**
Internet rumors often claim a secret list of "clients" exists. This is false.
*   We have **Flight Logs**.
*   We have the **Black Book**.
*   We have **Court Documents** naming people.

When people say "The List is released," they are usually referring to a batch of **Court Documents** (like the Jan 2024 release) that simply mentions names in depositions.
