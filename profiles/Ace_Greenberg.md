# 📉 Ace Greenberg: The Origin Point

> **Status**: **THE MENTOR / THE KEY**
> **Significance**: The man who took Epstein from a high school teacher to a Wall Street player.

## The Connection
Alan "Ace" Greenberg was the legendary CEO of **Bear Stearns**. In 1976, he hired a 23-year-old Jeffrey Epstein.

## The "Hiring" Mystery
*   **The Credentials**: Epstein had no college degree and had just been fired/resigned from the Dalton School.
*   **The Link**: Epstein was tutoring Greenberg's son and dating his daughter, Lynn.
*   **The Philosophy**: Greenberg famously said he liked to hire people who were "poor, smart, and desperate to be rich" (PSDs). He saw Epstein as the ultimate PSD.

## The Bear Stearns Years (1976-1981)
*   **The Rise**: Epstein rose rapidly to become a Limited Partner.
*   **The Fall**: In 1981, Epstein was forced to resign over a regulatory infraction (a minor violation).
*   **The Oddity**: He was the *only* employee punished, suggesting he may have taken the fall for a larger scheme.
*   **The Aftermath**: Despite the "firing," Greenberg remained a close friend and client of Epstein for decades, appearing in his Black Book and contributing to his 2003 birthday book.

## Verdict
Greenberg is the "Patient Zero" of the Epstein saga. Without Greenberg's unconventional hiring decision, Epstein likely would have remained an obscure math tutor. Greenberg gave him the legitimacy and the rolodex to meet Les Wexner and start his own firm.
