# ⚖️ Alan Dershowitz (Harvard Law Professor)

> **Status**: **ATTORNEY / ACCUSED (Recanted)** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Alan Dershowitz was one of Jeffrey Epstein's star defense attorneys. He helped negotiate the infamous 2008 Plea Deal (Non-Prosecution Agreement).

## The Accusations
*   **Virginia Giuffre**: For years, Giuffre alleged that Epstein trafficked her to Dershowitz for sex on multiple occasions.
*   **The Defamation War**: Dershowitz vehemently denied this, calling Giuffre a liar. They sued each other for defamation in a bitter, years-long legal battle.

## The Resolution (2022)
In November 2022, the lawsuits were dropped.
*   **The Statement**: Virginia Giuffre released a statement saying: *"I may have made a mistake in identifying Mr. Dershowitz."*
*   **The Implication**: She admitted she might have confused him with someone else, effectively clearing his name regarding the sexual assault.

## The Flight Logs
Dershowitz admits to flying on Epstein's plane frequently, but maintains it was for legal business or family travel to his own home in Martha's Vineyard.

## Verdict
**Defense Attorney.** While he was a key architect of the legal deal that protected Epstein, the sexual assault allegations against him personally have been withdrawn by the accuser.
