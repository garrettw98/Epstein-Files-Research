# Alexander Acosta (Former U.S. Attorney)

> **Status**: **PLEA-ERA DECISION MAKER**
> **Role in Repo**: Central prosecutor in 2007-2008 non-prosecution outcome

## Summary

Alexander Acosta served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida during the federal phase that ended in the 2007-2008 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein. In this repository, he is a core figure in explaining why early federal charging potential did not convert into full prosecution.

## Key Timeline

- **2007**: Federal draft indictment and prosecution pathway existed in South Florida.
- **2007-2008**: NPA was reached, broadly limiting exposure for unnamed co-conspirators.
- **2019**: Renewed scrutiny of Acosta's role intensified after Epstein's re-arrest.

## Why This Profile Matters

- Acosta's office was a decision node between aggressive prosecution and negotiated resolution.
- Later institutional reviews criticized judgment but did not fully resolve motive questions.

## Documented vs Unresolved

### Documented
- NPA structure and effect on accountability are documented.
- Plea-era outcome significantly reduced immediate federal exposure.

### Unresolved
- Degree of external pressure versus internal legal strategy in final decision path.
- Full chain of prosecutorial decision-making documents available to the public.
