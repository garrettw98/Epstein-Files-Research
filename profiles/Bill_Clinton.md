# 🇺🇸 Bill Clinton (Former US President)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / FLIGHT LOGS** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Bill Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's private plane (the "Lolita Express") multiple times in the early 2000s, primarily for trips related to the Clinton Foundation's work in Africa and Asia.

## The Evidence
*   **Flight Logs**: Released logs show Clinton on approximately **26 flight legs**.
*   **Context**: Many of these trips included other passengers like Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker for humanitarian tours.
*   **2026 Update**: Emails from the Jan 2026 release mention him at an after-party at Ghislaine Maxwell's home.
    *   *Detail*: Specific emails discuss "Foundation Logistics" and scheduling that align with dates victims were known to be present at properties, though no emails explicitly mention the victims in the context of Clinton.

## The Accusations
*   **None by Victims**: To date, **no victim** in the verified court documents has accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or misconduct.
*   **Virginia Giuffre**: Stated she saw Clinton on the island but never saw him participate in any abuse.

## The Defense
*   Clinton's spokesperson has repeatedly stated he knew nothing of Epstein's crimes and had not spoken to him in over a decade prior to Epstein's arrest.
*   He denies ever visiting the private island (Little St. James), though flight logs place the plane nearby (St. Thomas), pilot logs and Secret Service records have been scrutinized.

## Verdict
**Verified Associate.** He traveled with Epstein extensively, but there is **no evidence** currently linking him to the sexual crimes.
