# 🇺🇸 Bill Clinton (Former US President)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / FLIGHT LOGS** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Bill Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's private plane (the "Lolita Express") multiple times in the early 2000s, primarily for trips related to the Clinton Foundation's work in Africa and Asia.

## The Evidence
*   **Flight Logs**: Released logs show Clinton on approximately **26 flight legs**.
*   **Context**: Many of these trips included other passengers like Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker for humanitarian tours.
*   **2026 Update**: Emails from the Jan 2026 release mention him at an after-party at Ghislaine Maxwell's home.
    *   *Detail*: Specific emails discuss "Foundation Logistics" and scheduling that align with dates victims were known to be present at properties, though no emails explicitly mention the victims in the context of Clinton.

## The Accusations
*   **None by Victims**: To date, **no victim** in the verified court documents has accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or misconduct.
*   **Virginia Giuffre**: Stated she saw Clinton on the island but never saw him participate in any abuse.

## The Defense
*   Clinton's spokesperson has repeatedly stated he knew nothing of Epstein's crimes and had not spoken to him in over a decade prior to Epstein's arrest.
*   He denies ever visiting the private island (Little St. James), though flight logs place the plane nearby (St. Thomas), pilot logs and Secret Service records have been scrutinized.

## The 2025-2026 Congressional Investigation

### House Oversight Subpoenas

In July 2025, the House Oversight Committee's Federal Law Enforcement Subcommittee voted **unanimously** (bipartisan) to subpoena both Bill and Hillary Clinton for testimony about their Epstein connections.

**Subpoenas Issued**: August 5, 2025

### The Contempt Standoff

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Oct 14, 2025 | Original deposition date (Bill) - Rescheduled |
| Dec 17, 2025 | Second date - Rescheduled |
| Jan 13, 2026 | Bill Clinton **failed to appear** |
| Jan 14, 2026 | Hillary Clinton **failed to appear** |
| Jan 21, 2026 | Committee votes to recommend **contempt of Congress** |

### Legal Arguments

The Clintons' attorneys argued:
- Subpoenas were **"invalid and legally unenforceable"**
- They were being **"unfairly singled out"**

### Democratic Division

Notably, **nine Democrats** on the Oversight panel supported the contempt vote against the Clintons—breaking from typical party-line votes.

### Resolution

On **February 3, 2026**, the Clintons agreed to appear for closed-door depositions:
- **Hillary Clinton**: February 26, 2026
- **Bill Clinton**: February 27, 2026

Chairman Comer announced: "The Clintons caved."

### 2026 Document Revelations

The January 2026 release included:
- **Never-before-seen photos** of Clinton and Epstein together (from Epstein's NY home)
- **Frequent communications** between Ghislaine Maxwell and Clinton staffers (2001-2004)
- FBI file entries showing public inquiries demanding investigation of Clinton

## February 5, 2026: Hillary Pushes for Public Hearing

On February 5, 2026, former Secretary of State **Hillary Clinton** challenged Republicans to take the testimony **in public**, not behind closed doors.

Chairman Comer responded that the Clintons would not be *"treated differently than everyone else"* and the subpoenas called for depositions, not a public hearing. He added: *"If they get through the depositions and they still want a public hearing, we'll try to do something."*

### Democratic Warning

Rep. **Jamie Raskin** (D-MD) warned of precedent:
> *"It's clear that past presidents are not off limits for subpoenas... If there is a former president who doesn't render substantial good-faith compliance, they're going to be in trouble under this precedent. All bets are off."*

This was widely interpreted as a warning that Democrats would seek to subpoena **Donald Trump** next.

## The 2016 Deposition

Epstein sat for a deposition in 2016 and was asked several questions about Clinton. He responded **"Fifth"** — invoking his Fifth Amendment right — to **every question** about the former president.

## Verdict
**Verified Associate.** He traveled with Epstein extensively, but there is **no evidence** currently linking him to the sexual crimes. No victim has accused Clinton of abuse.

The February 26-27, 2026 depositions may reveal additional information about the relationship. Hillary Clinton's push for public testimony suggests confidence in their defense.
