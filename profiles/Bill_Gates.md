# 💻 Bill Gates (Microsoft Founder)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / PHILANTHROPY** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Unlike Trump or Clinton, Bill Gates' relationship with Epstein began **after** Epstein was a convicted sex offender (post-2008).

## The Evidence
*   **The Meetings**: Gates met with Epstein multiple times starting in 2011, including at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse.
*   **The Topic**: Gates claims they discussed philanthropy and global health funding. Epstein wanted to help Gates secure funding from other billionaires (like Leon Black) for the Gates Foundation.
*   **The Flight**: Gates flew on the "Lolita Express" to Palm Beach in 2013 (after Epstein's release).

## The "Extortion" Email (2026 Confirmation)
*   **The Story**: Reports (confirmed by the 2026 release) suggest Epstein tried to blackmail Gates.
*   **The Affair**: Epstein allegedly discovered Gates had an affair with a Russian bridge player, **Mila Antonova**.
*   **The Threat**: Epstein paid for Antonova's coding school tuition. Years later, he emailed Gates asking to be reimbursed, essentially threatening to reveal the affair if Gates cut ties.
*   **Nobel Prize Lobbying**: The 2026 files reveal a coordinated campaign by Epstein to help Gates win a Nobel Peace Prize.
    *   *The Mechanism*: Epstein leveraged his relationship with **Thorbjørn Jagland** (Chairman of the Nobel Committee) to lobby for Gates.
    *   *The Quid Pro Quo*: This suggests Epstein wasn't just "hanging out"; he was offering Gates a tangible, high-value service (The Nobel) in exchange for legitimacy.

## The Fallout
*   **Divorce**: Melinda French Gates cited Bill's relationship with Epstein as a key reason for their divorce, stating she had "nightmares" after meeting Epstein once.
*   **Regret**: Gates has publicly called the meetings a "huge mistake" and "error in judgment."

## February 2026 Public Statements

### Bill Gates' Response

Following the January 2026 document release, Gates spoke publicly for the first time:

> **"I was foolish"** to spend time with Epstein.

A spokesperson for Gates stated:
- The claims in the documents are **"absolutely absurd and completely false"**
- The documents demonstrate **"Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates"**

### Melinda French Gates' Response

Melinda French Gates also responded to the latest revelations:

> **"Unbelievable sadness"**

She expressed distress over the continued revelations and maintained that her exposure to Epstein (a single meeting) contributed to her decision to divorce.

### Document Context

The 2026 files show:
- Extensive correspondence attempting to maintain Gates' engagement
- Evidence that Epstein tried to leverage the relationship more than Gates reciprocated
- Gates distancing himself over time

## The Pattern

The Gates-Epstein relationship illustrates a key pattern:
1. **Initial Contact**: Epstein offered valuable services (funding connections, Nobel lobbying)
2. **Entanglement**: Multiple meetings despite Epstein's conviction
3. **Attempted Leverage**: Epstein tried blackmail when Gates pulled away
4. **Public Reckoning**: Years later, the full scope becomes public

## Verdict
**Professional/Philanthropic Associate.** Gates sought Epstein's money/connections. Epstein sought Gates' legitimacy. No evidence links Gates to the abuse.

The February 2026 statements acknowledge the relationship was a mistake but deny any wrongdoing.
