# 💻 Bill Gates (Microsoft Founder)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / PHILANTHROPY** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Unlike Trump or Clinton, Bill Gates' relationship with Epstein began **after** Epstein was a convicted sex offender (post-2008).

## The Evidence
*   **The Meetings**: Gates met with Epstein multiple times starting in 2011, including at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse.
*   **The Topic**: Gates claims they discussed philanthropy and global health funding. Epstein wanted to help Gates secure funding from other billionaires (like Leon Black) for the Gates Foundation.
*   **The Flight**: Gates flew on the "Lolita Express" to Palm Beach in 2013 (after Epstein's release).

## The "Extortion" Email (2026 Confirmation)
*   **The Story**: Reports (confirmed by the 2026 release) suggest Epstein tried to blackmail Gates.
*   **The Affair**: Epstein allegedly discovered Gates had an affair with a Russian bridge player, **Mila Antonova**.
*   **The Threat**: Epstein paid for Antonova's coding school tuition. Years later, he emailed Gates asking to be reimbursed, essentially threatening to reveal the affair if Gates cut ties.

## The Fallout
*   **Divorce**: Melinda French Gates cited Bill's relationship with Epstein as a key reason for their divorce, stating she had "nightmares" after meeting Epstein once.
*   **Regret**: Gates has publicly called the meetings a "huge mistake" and "error in judgment."

## Verdict
**Professional/Philanthropic Associate.** Gates sought Epstein's money/connections. Epstein sought Gates' legitimacy. No evidence links Gates to the abuse.
