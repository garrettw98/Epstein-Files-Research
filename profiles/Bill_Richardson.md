# 🇺🇸 Bill Richardson (Former Governor/UN Ambassador)

> **Status**: **ACCUSED** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Bill Richardson was a prominent Democrat, former Governor of New Mexico, and US Ambassador to the UN. His name surfaced in the 2024 unsealed documents.

## The Accusations
*   **Virginia Giuffre**: In sworn depositions, Giuffre alleged she was directed to have sex with Richardson.
*   **Locations**: She claimed these encounters happened at Epstein's properties, including in New Mexico (where Richardson was Governor).

## The Defense
*   **Denial**: Before his death, Richardson vehemently denied ever meeting Giuffre or knowing Epstein personally.
*   **"Offer of Proof"**: His name appeared in a legal document where Giuffre's lawyers listed people they intended to prove participated in the trafficking.

## The Outcome
*   **Deceased**: Richardson died in 2023, before the 2024 documents were unsealed.
*   **No Charges**: He was never criminally charged.

## Verdict
**Accused by Victim.** Unlike Gates or Hoffman, Richardson faces a direct, sworn allegation of sexual abuse, though he can no longer defend himself.
