# ⚖️ Brad Karp (Paul Weiss Chairman)

> **Status**: **RESIGNED / DOCUMENTED TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Brad Karp served as Chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison — one of the most prestigious law firms in the United States. The January 2026 document release revealed a series of emails exposing a far warmer and more compromising relationship with Jeffrey Epstein than previously known, leading to his resignation as chairman on February 4, 2026.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### The "Extraordinary Host" Email
Karp sent an email to Epstein thanking him for being an **"extraordinary host"** — language suggesting social visits, not arms-length professional dealings.

### The Woody Allen Film Request (2016)
In a 2016 email, Karp asked Epstein to find his son a role in a **Woody Allen film**:
- This demonstrates Karp viewed Epstein as a personal favor broker
- Epstein's connection to Woody Allen is well-documented in the files
- The request came **eight years after** Epstein's 2008 conviction

### The Confidential Client Leak
Perhaps the most damaging revelation: Karp shared a **confidential client stock sale agreement** with Epstein, writing:

> **"Please don't let him know I shared it. It is supposed to be strictly confidential."**

This represents a potential breach of attorney-client privilege and professional ethics — from the chairman of a major law firm.

### Reviewing Epstein's Legal Filings (2019)
Despite Paul Weiss publicly claiming the firm **never represented Jeffrey Epstein**, the 2026 files show Karp personally **reviewed Epstein's legal filings in 2019** — the year of Epstein's arrest and death.

### Disparaging the Victims
In emails, Karp disparaged Epstein's victims, writing that:

> **"'victims' lied in wait and sat on their rights"**

The use of scare quotes around "victims" is particularly notable, suggesting Karp questioned the legitimacy of their claims.

### The John Havens Connection
Emails show Karp connected Epstein to **John Havens**, the former President of Citigroup. This placed Karp in the role of network facilitator — expanding Epstein's access to elite financial circles.

### The Robert Kraft Connection
Emails reveal Epstein offered to help find a lawyer for **Robert Kraft**, the owner of the New England Patriots. This demonstrates Epstein's role as a legal fixer for the ultra-wealthy, with Karp as an intermediary.

## The Resignation

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 30, 2026 | DOJ releases documents |
| Early Feb 2026 | Karp's emails surface in files |
| Feb 4, 2026 | Karp resigns as Chairman of Paul Weiss |

### Succession
- **Scott Barshay** replaced Karp as Chairman of Paul Weiss
- Karp **will remain at the firm** in a non-leadership capacity

## The Significance

The Karp revelations are significant on multiple levels:

1. **Attorney-Client Privilege**: A chairman of a major law firm shared confidential client documents with a convicted sex offender
2. **Victim Disparagement**: The head of a firm that publicly champions pro bono work mocked trafficking victims
3. **Hidden Representation**: The firm denied any Epstein relationship while its chairman was reviewing his legal filings
4. **Network Building**: Karp actively connected Epstein to powerful figures in finance

## Verdict
**Documented Ties Leading to Resignation.** Karp's emails reveal a relationship that went far beyond casual acquaintance — he shared confidential legal documents, sought personal favors, facilitated introductions, and disparaged victims. His resignation as chairman was swift, though his continued presence at the firm raises questions about full accountability.
