# 🎬 Brett Ratner (Film Director)

> **Status**: **PHOTOGRAPHED / SOCIAL TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Brett Ratner, director of *Rush Hour* and the 2026 Amazon documentary *Melania*, appeared in multiple photos with Epstein released in the January 2026 files — timing that created a firestorm given the documentary's simultaneous theatrical release.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### Photos
- **Couch Photo**: Shows Ratner with his arm around a woman in a white top, seated on a couch next to Epstein, who has his arm around another woman (faces redacted)
- **Group Photo**: Shows Ratner with Epstein, **Jean-Luc Brunel**, and three women on a separate occasion
- **December 2025 Release**: An earlier photo showed Ratner posing with **Jean-Luc Brunel** (Epstein's modeling agent, who died in prison in 2022)

### Emails
- **Cannes 2012**: Celebrity publicist **Peggy Siegal** emailed Epstein that she was sitting with Ratner watching a Roman Polanski documentary, adding: *"Brett says 'hi' and he loves you!"*
- **Dinner Invite**: Epstein's assistant sent Ratner a dinner party invitation; it is unknown if he attended
- **Phone Request**: Epstein's assistant emailed Ratner asking him to call

## The *Melania* Documentary Timing

The DOJ released the Ratner-Epstein photos on **January 30, 2026** — one day after Ratner appeared on the red carpet for *Melania*, his comeback film:

- Amazon MGM Studios paid **$40 million** for rights and **$35 million** for marketing
- The documentary opened with **$7.1 million** at the box office — the best for a feature documentary in a decade, but a low return on investment
- **6% rating** on Rotten Tomatoes
- **Two-thirds** of the New York crew requested their names not appear in credits

## Prior Sexual Misconduct Allegations

In **2017**, six women — including **Olivia Munn** and **Natasha Henstridge** — accused Ratner of sexual misconduct. He denied all allegations. *Melania* was his first major project since those accusations.

## Ratner's Response

Speaking to **Fox News Digital**:
> *"We went to an event, and we were sitting on the couch, and the photo was taken at that event. I didn't have a personal relationship with him [Epstein]. I didn't know him."*

He stated that the woman in the couch photo was his **former fiancee**.

## Verdict
**Social Acquaintance.** Ratner appears in photos and emails suggesting more than a passing connection, particularly through Jean-Luc Brunel. However, he has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the timing of the photo release alongside the *Melania* premiere may be coincidental.
