# 🌴 Courtney Wild

> **Role**: **The Voice of Florida**
> **Significance**: Challenged the illegal 2008 Plea Deal in court for over a decade.

## The Story
Recruited at age 14 in West Palm Beach, Courtney Wild was one of the dozens of local girls victimized during the 2005-2007 period.

## The Fight Against the Plea Deal
When the federal government gave Epstein the secret "Non-Prosecution Agreement" (NPA) in 2008, they violated the **Crime Victims' Rights Act** by not informing the victims.
*   **The Lawsuit**: Wild (along with others) sued the federal government to invalidate the deal.
*   **The Victory**: In 2019, a judge ruled that the prosecutors *did* violate the law. While it was too late to undo the 2008 sentence, this ruling validated the victims and helped lead to Alexander Acosta's resignation.

## Why She Matters
Courtney Wild represents the local, working-class girls who were preyed upon in Florida. Her legal battle exposed the corruption of the justice system that prioritized a billionaire's comfort over children's rights.
