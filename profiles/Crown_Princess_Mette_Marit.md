# 👑 Crown Princess Mette-Marit (Norway)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / EXTENSIVE CONTACT** (Evidence Level: ● SUBSTANTIAL - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway, wife of Crown Prince Haakon and a member of the Norwegian Royal Family, maintained an extensive correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein that was revealed in the January 2026 document release. Her name appears **over 1,000 times** in the files, and the revelations have shaken public confidence in the monarchy.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### The Volume of Contact
- **1,000+ mentions** in the released files
- **100+ friendly emails** exchanged with Epstein
- This volume places her among the most frequently referenced individuals in the entire document release

### The Palm Beach Stay (2013)
Mette-Marit stayed at Epstein's **Palm Beach home for several days in 2013**:
- This was **five years after** Epstein's 2008 conviction
- Palm Beach was the location of much of Epstein's documented abuse
- A multi-day stay indicates a level of comfort and familiarity beyond casual contact

### The Google Search (2011)
In 2011, Mette-Marit Googled Epstein's name and told him the results **"didn't look good"**:
- This proves she was **aware of the allegations** against Epstein
- Despite seeing concerning search results, she continued the relationship for years
- The contact extended through at least 2013 (Palm Beach stay)

### Cosmetic Procedures
Epstein **arranged cosmetic procedures** for Mette-Marit in Palm Beach:
- This demonstrates a personal, intimate level of involvement
- Epstein served as a personal fixer and concierge for the Crown Princess
- It deepened the sense of obligation and entanglement

## The Family Context

### Marius Borg Hoiby
The Epstein revelations emerged just days before Crown Princess Mette-Marit's son, **Marius Borg Hoiby** (from a prior relationship), faced a **rape trial** in Norway — creating a double crisis for the Royal Family.

### Monarchy Stability
Despite the revelations, a parliamentary vote on the Norwegian monarchy **passed overwhelmingly**, indicating the institution retains public support even as the Crown Princess faces scrutiny.

## Official Statements

### Mette-Marit's Statement
The Crown Princess issued a public statement acknowledging her failure:

> **"I must take responsibility for not having investigated Epstein's background more thoroughly... I showed poor judgment."**

### Prime Minister's Response
Norwegian Prime Minister **Jonas Gahr Store** agreed that Mette-Marit showed **"lack of judgment"** — a notable rebuke from the head of government directed at a member of the Royal Family.

## The Fallout

### Institutional Consequences
- Norway's **largest sexual health center** cut ties with the Crown Princess following the revelations
- Public trust in her charitable work has been significantly damaged
- The timing alongside her son's legal troubles compounded the reputational crisis

## The Pattern
Mette-Marit's case illustrates a specific dynamic in Epstein's network:

1. **Access to Royalty**: Epstein collected connections to royal families (Prince Andrew, Sarah Ferguson, Mette-Marit)
2. **Personal Services**: Arranging cosmetic procedures created dependency and obligation
3. **Awareness Without Action**: She knew about the allegations (the Google search) but continued the relationship
4. **Volume of Contact**: 100+ emails suggests a sustained, active correspondence — not incidental contact

## Verdict
**Extensively Documented Associate.** With over 1,000 mentions in the files, 100+ emails, a multi-day stay at his Palm Beach home, and arranged cosmetic procedures, Mette-Marit's relationship with Epstein was deep and sustained. Her own acknowledgment of "poor judgment" and the Prime Minister's public agreement confirm the gravity of the association. No allegations of criminal conduct have been made against her.
