# 🎩 David Copperfield (Illusionist)

> **Status**: **MENTIONED / SOCIAL TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
David Copperfield, one of the most famous illusionists in the world, had a social relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that included performing at Epstein's home and appearing in victim depositions.

## Key Evidence

### Home Performances
*   Copperfield would come to Epstein's home to **perform magic tricks** for Epstein and his guests.
*   *Context*: Epstein frequently used celebrity visitors -- scientists, politicians, entertainers -- to create an atmosphere of legitimacy and glamour around his properties. Private performances served as social currency in his network.

### House Manager Testimony (Juan Alessi)
*   Epstein's house manager **Juan Alessi** stated that the **girls were not naked** while Copperfield was present at the home.
*   *Significance*: The fact that Alessi felt it necessary to specify this distinction implies that nudity was the norm at other times -- and that Copperfield's visits were treated differently from the usual operations of the household.

### Virginia Giuffre Deposition
*   Copperfield was **named in the Virginia Giuffre deposition**, placing him within the broader network of individuals Giuffre identified during her testimony.

## The Defense
*   Copperfield has **denied any wrongdoing**.
*   No victim has accused Copperfield of participating in sexual abuse.

## Verdict
**Mentioned / Social Ties.** Copperfield performed at Epstein's home and is named in the Giuffre deposition. Alessi's testimony that girls were clothed during his visits suggests the household distinguished between social entertainment and its darker operations. No evidence links Copperfield to the abuse, but his presence in victim testimony and at the home is documented.
