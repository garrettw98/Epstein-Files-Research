# 🧘 Deepak Chopra (New Age Guru)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / DOCUMENTED CORRESPONDENCE** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Deepak Chopra is a world-famous author, speaker, and alternative medicine advocate who holds a professorship at UC San Diego. The January 2026 document release revealed a frequent and familiar correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein that extended to personal, financial, and social matters.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### Frequent Correspondence
The files show Chopra and Epstein:
- **Corresponded frequently** by email
- **Exchanged news articles** on topics of mutual interest
- **Arranged meetings** in person
- Maintained a relationship that went well beyond casual acquaintance

### The "Cute Girls" Email (March 8, 2017)
In a March 8, 2017 email to Epstein, Chopra wrote:

> **"God is a construct. Cute girls are real."**

This email is notable because:
- It was sent by a spiritual leader known for teachings on consciousness and transcendence
- The juxtaposition of philosophy and commentary about "cute girls" mirrors Epstein's own pattern of mixing intellectual discussion with objectification of women
- It suggests Chopra was comfortable engaging in this type of language with Epstein

### The Voice Message
Chopra left a **voice message** for Epstein seeking **financial advice**:
- This demonstrates Epstein maintained his role as financial advisor to the wealthy and famous
- It shows Chopra actively sought Epstein's guidance, not the reverse

### The 23andMe Test
Chopra sent his **genetic 23andMe test results** to Epstein:
- Epstein was known for his obsessive interest in genetics and eugenics
- Sharing personal genetic data represents an unusual level of trust and intimacy
- This connects to Epstein's broader interest in [Transhumanism and Eugenics](../topics/Transhumanism_and_Eugenics.md)

### The Woody Allen / Leonardo DiCaprio Dinner
Epstein emailed a contact wondering if **"Leonardo DiCaprio would want to have dinner with Woody [Allen]"** in an email chain that involved Chopra:
- This places Chopra within Epstein's social coordination network
- The chain connects Chopra to Epstein's Hollywood circle
- Woody Allen's own relationship with Epstein is extensively documented

## Chopra's Statement
Following the revelations, Chopra issued a statement:

> **"I was never involved in, nor did I participate in, any criminal or exploitative conduct."**

### Analysis of Response

| Element | Context |
|---------|---------|
| Denies criminal involvement | No allegations of criminal conduct have been made |
| Does not address frequency of contact | Files show sustained correspondence |
| Does not address specific emails | The "cute girls" email remains unaddressed |
| Standard denial format | Similar to statements from other associates |

## The Pattern
Chopra fits a recognizable pattern in Epstein's network:

1. **Intellectual Legitimacy**: Epstein surrounded himself with prominent thinkers and authors
2. **Science Connection**: The 23andMe test feeds into Epstein's genetics obsession
3. **Financial Advisory**: Epstein maintained influence by offering financial guidance
4. **Social Brokering**: The DiCaprio/Allen dinner chain shows Epstein as connector

## Verdict
**Documented Associate with Frequent Correspondence.** Chopra maintained a sustained relationship with Epstein that included personal emails, financial consultations, genetic data sharing, and social networking. The "cute girls are real" email stands out as a particularly uncomfortable exchange from a spiritual leader. No allegations of criminal conduct have been made against Chopra.
