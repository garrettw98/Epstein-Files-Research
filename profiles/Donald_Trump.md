# 🇺🇸 Donald Trump (Former US President)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / SOCIAL TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein moved in the same Palm Beach / New York social circles for nearly two decades (1980s-2000s).

## The Evidence
*   **The "Terrific Guy" Quote**: In a 2002 *New York Magazine* article, Trump said: *"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."*
*   **Flight Logs**: Trump flew on Epstein's plane (verified 7 flights), specifically from Palm Beach to New York in the 1990s.
*   **The Rift**: The friendship reportedly ended around 2004. One account says they fought over a property (Maison de L'Amitie); another says Trump banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for hitting on a member's teenage daughter.

## The Accusations
*   **2016 "Jane Doe" Lawsuit**: An anonymous woman filed a lawsuit alleging Trump and Epstein raped her in 1994 when she was 13.
    *   *Outcome*: The lawsuit was filed and withdrawn multiple times during the 2016 election. **No evidence was ever presented**, and the case never went to trial.
*   **2024 Testimony**: In the unsealed depositions, victim **Johanna Sjoberg** specifically testified that she **never** saw Trump on Epstein's island or participating in abuse.

## Verdict
**Social Associate.** They partied together in the 90s. While Trump made the "likes them young" comment, there is **no verified evidence** linking him to the trafficking operation, and key witnesses have exonerated him of being at the crime scenes (the island).
