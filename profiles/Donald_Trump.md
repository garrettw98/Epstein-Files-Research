# 🇺🇸 Donald Trump (Former US President)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / SOCIAL TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein moved in the same Palm Beach / New York social circles for nearly two decades (1980s-2000s).

## The Evidence
*   **The "Terrific Guy" Quote**: In a 2002 *New York Magazine* article, Trump said: *"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."*
*   **The "Circled" Name**: Epstein's house manager, **Alfredo Rodriguez**, specifically circled Trump's name in the stolen "Black Book" as a "material witness" (along with Prince Andrew and Ehud Barak).
*   **Flight Logs**: Trump flew on Epstein's plane (verified 7 flights), specifically from Palm Beach to New York in the 1990s.
*   **The Rift**: The friendship reportedly ended around 2004. One account says they fought over a property (Maison de L'Amitie); another says Trump banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for hitting on a member's teenage daughter.
*   **2026 Update (The "Rift" Emails)**: Newly released emails from 2005 show Epstein complaining to Ghislaine Maxwell about Trump's "disloyalty" and "distancing," corroborating the timeline that they had fallen out *before* the 2008 investigation became public.

## The Accusations
*   **2016 "Jane Doe" Lawsuit**: An anonymous woman filed a lawsuit alleging Trump and Epstein raped her in 1994 when she was 13.
    *   *Outcome*: The lawsuit was filed and withdrawn multiple times during the 2016 election. **No evidence was ever presented**, and the case never went to trial.
*   **2024 Testimony**: In the unsealed depositions, victim **Johanna Sjoberg** specifically testified that she **never** saw Trump on Epstein's island or participating in abuse.

## 2026 Revelations

### Flight Records
The December 2025 DOJ release showed Trump flew on Epstein's plane **at least 8 times** (previously documented as 7), specifically from Palm Beach to New York in the 1990s.

### FBI Complaint List
The January 2026 release included an **FBI-compiled list of sexual assault allegations** related to Trump:
- **16 complaints** submitted to the FBI
- At least **8 of 16** did not include contact information
- **13 of 16** mention Trump personally
- Most appear to be **unverified public tips** submitted around the 2020 election

### The "Jane Doe" FBI Form
The files include an FBI form detailing the **same allegations** from the 2016 "Jane Doe" lawsuit — a woman who accused Trump of raping her at age 13 at an Epstein party in 1994. The lawsuit was filed and withdrawn multiple times. **No evidence was ever presented**, and the case never went to trial.

### DOJ Disclaimer
The DOJ issued a specific disclaimer about these documents:
> *"Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election."*
> *"To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false."*

### House Manager Testimony
A newly highlighted **2009 deposition** from Epstein's former house manager, **Juan Alessi**, states:
- Trump **"never" stayed over** at Epstein's Palm Beach home
- Trump **never got a massage** there
- Trump would come to dinner but **ate with Alessi in the kitchen**, not at the formal table
- Alessi drove Ghislaine Maxwell to Mar-a-Lago on one occasion

### Deputy AG Statement
Deputy AG Todd Blanche: *"We comply with the act, and there is no 'protect President Trump.' We didn't protect or not protect anybody."*

### Trump's Name in the Files
Trump's name appears **thousands of times** in the documents, though the DOJ notes a "significant majority" are mentions in news articles rather than direct communications.

## Verdict
**Social Associate.** They were in the same circles in the 1990s. Trump made the "likes them young" comment and flew on the plane at least 8 times. However, there is **no verified evidence** linking him to the trafficking operation, key witnesses have excluded him from the island and abuse scenes, and the FBI complaint list consists of unverified public tips. The 2026 files do not materially change his evidentiary status.
