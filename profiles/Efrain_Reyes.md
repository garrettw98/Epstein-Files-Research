# Efrain Reyes (MCC Cellmate Transfer Figure)

> **Status**: **CUSTODY-TIMELINE FIGURE**

## Summary

Efrain Reyes appears in custody-sequence reporting as the cellmate transferred out before Epstein's death, after which no replacement was assigned. This transfer sequence is one of the key documented process failures in death-timeline analysis.

## Timeline Anchor

- **Aug 2019**: Reyes transfer out, followed by no replacement cellmate assignment in a high-risk window.

## Why This Matters

- Cellmate assignment and monitoring protocols are central to official custody-failure findings.
- The transfer sequence is repeatedly cited in death-timeline reconstruction.
