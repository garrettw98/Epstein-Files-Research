# 🇮🇱 Ehud Barak (Former Israeli Prime Minister)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / DOCUMENTED TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Ehud Barak, former Prime Minister of Israel and former Defense Minister, maintained a documented relationship with Jeffrey Epstein from at least 2003 through 2017. The 2026 files significantly expanded what was known about their connection.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### Apartment Stays (2013-2017)
Barak and his wife, **Nili Priel**, stayed at an Epstein-owned apartment in New York **multiple times** between 2013 and 2017:
- **May 2017**: Priel emailed Epstein that she and Barak would temporarily leave the apartment while traveling to Harvard, asking that cleaning be arranged during their absence
- Epstein's assistant **Lesley Groff** wrote about switching the cable box in "the Baraks' apartment" for an Apple TV

### Audio Recording
An **undated recorded conversation** between Epstein and Barak captured Epstein:
- Suggesting Barak **"look at" Palantir** (the surveillance technology firm)
- Mentioning a planned meeting with **Peter Thiel**

### Political Mediation
In a **September 2016** email during the presidential race:
- Barak informed Epstein that **Hillary Clinton** was set to be interviewed by Israel's Channel-2
- Asked if Epstein could inquire whether **Donald Trump** would be interested in an interview on rival station Channel-10

### Dinner Schedule
A personalized schedule for **August 2016** shows that **Tom Barrack**, **Ehud Barak**, and Russian diplomat **Vitaly Churkin** were scheduled to have dinner with Epstein.

### Photos
A previously unreleased photo shows Barak at a table with **Thomas Pritzker**, **Woody Allen**, **David Blaine**, and Epstein — released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.

### Financial Ties
- **2004**: Barak received **$2.3 million** from the Wexner Foundation for "research"
- **Carbyne**: An Israeli 911-technology startup co-funded by Epstein and Barak

## Intelligence Allegations

An **FBI memo** in the released files cites a confidential human source alleging:
- Epstein **"worked with Israeli intelligence"**
- Was believed to be a **"co-opted Mossad agent"**
- Was **"close to the former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak"**

This memo does not constitute judicial findings, but its inclusion in an official FBI file indicates the allegations were documented within a counter-intelligence framework.

## Prior Knowledge

Barak has previously:
- Confirmed knowing Epstein since **2003**
- Confirmed maintaining contact **after Epstein's 2008 conviction**
- Said he **neither witnessed nor participated** in any illegal or inappropriate activity

## Feb 13, 2026 Public Statement

In an interview broadcast in Israel, Barak said he regrets his relationship with Epstein and apologized publicly.

## Verdict
**Documented Long-Term Associate.** Barak stayed in Epstein's properties, appeared in photos, is linked through financial transactions, and maintained the relationship for over a decade — including after Epstein's conviction. The FBI intelligence memo adds a layer of concern, though no allegations of participation in crimes have been substantiated.
