# 🚀 Elon Musk (Tesla/SpaceX)

> **Status**: **MENTIONED / UNVERIFIED VISITOR** (Evidence Level: ? SPECULATIVE CONNECTION)

## The Connection
Elon Musk's name appears in Epstein's emails and schedules. The nature of their relationship has been a subject of intense speculation.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)
*   **The "Kung Fu" Email**: An email from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell notes: "Call Elon about Kung Fu practice."
    *   *Context*: Musk has stated this refers to a martial arts demonstration that never happened or was a joke.
*   **The "Holiday" Email**: An email discusses a potential "holiday visit" to the island for Musk and his family.
    *   *Verification*: **No flight log or witness testimony** confirms this trip ever took place. Musk denies ever going.
*   **The Kimball Musk Dinner**: Documented attendance by Elon's brother, Kimball, at an Epstein dinner. Elon was invited but attendance is unconfirmed.

## The "Advisory" Role
Epstein notoriously tried to insert himself into high-profile business disputes. Emails suggest Epstein *attempted* to offer advice during Tesla's "taking private" controversy in 2018, but Musk claims he rebuffed these overtures.

## Verdict
**Targeted by Epstein.** Epstein clearly wanted Musk in his orbit and aggressively courted him. While they communicated, there is **no verified evidence** (flight logs/photos) that Musk visited the island or engaged in business with him.
