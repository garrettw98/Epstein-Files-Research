# 🚀 Elon Musk (Tesla/SpaceX)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / EXTENSIVE CORRESPONDENCE** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
The January 2026 DOJ release revealed a significantly deeper relationship between Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein than Musk had publicly acknowledged, including at least **16 emails** between 2012 and 2014 and multiple planned visits to Epstein's private island.

## Musk's Prior Denials

Musk has repeatedly downplayed the connection:
- **2019 (Vanity Fair)**: Called Epstein a "creep" and said Epstein "tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island" but that he declined.
- **2025 (X post)**: "Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED."

The 2026 files tell a more complicated story.

## The Email Timeline (2026 Files)

### Late 2012: First Contact
- **September 2012**: Earliest email in the files. Musk writes that they had a "very enjoyable" conversation.
- **October 2012**: Musk writes to Epstein: **"The world needs more romance."** Says he will be traveling to St. Barts with his wife, actress **Talulah Riley**.
- **October 2012**: Musk forwards questions from Epstein to his cousin **Peter Rive** (SolarCity founder). Epstein asks if SolarCity could electrify his New Mexico ranch or his private island.
- **November 25, 2012**: Epstein asks Musk how many people he'll be bringing for the **helicopter ride to the island**. Musk responds: **"Probably just Talulah and me."**
- **November 2012**: Musk asks: **"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?"**
- **December 25, 2012**: Musk writes again, asking about parties: **"Do you have any parties planned? I've been working to the edge of sanity this year, and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St. Barts or elsewhere and let loose."**

### Early 2013: Lunch Plans
- **January 2013**: Musk and Epstein discuss lunch plans on St. Barts. Epstein says he'll fly from his island. Musk cancels the day of, saying he's not feeling well.
- **February 2013**: Plans for Musk and Epstein to have lunch at **SpaceX's office** near Los Angeles. Their assistants coordinate details.

### Late 2013: Another Island Visit Planned
- **December 2013**: Musk writes: **"Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?"**
- Epstein responds: **"Any day 1st — 8th. Play it by ear if you want. Always space for you."**
- Epstein offers: **"I will send heli for you."** Musk replies: **"Thanks."**
- **December 25, 2013**: Musk writes: **"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's."** Asks if he and Riley should head to the island the day before.

### 2014: Schedule Entry
- **October 2014**: Epstein's assistant **Lesley Groff** sends a schedule reminder noting Musk **"is to go to the island on Dec. 6th."**
- **December 5, 2014**: A follow-up schedule note asks: **"Reminder: Elon Musk to island Dec. 6 (is this still happening?)"**

## Other Email Topics
- Emails show discussions about **solar energy** and **the importance of sleep**
- Assistants coordinated possible meetings
- A **2011 dinner guest list** of ~30 people included Musk alongside **Jeff Bezos** and **Sergey Brin**

## Did Musk Actually Visit the Island?

**Unknown.** The emails show Musk and Epstein planned holiday visits at the end of 2012 and 2013, but their schedules did not always align. Both men appeared eager to meet on Little St. James. Notably, it was **Epstein, not Musk**, who cancelled the second planned visit.

**No flight log or photographic evidence** confirming Musk physically set foot on the island has been released. However, the emails contradict Musk's public claim that he flatly "REFUSED" to visit.

## The "Advisory" Role
Epstein tried to insert himself into high-profile business disputes. Emails suggest Epstein attempted to offer advice during Tesla's "taking private" controversy in 2018, but Musk claims he rebuffed these overtures.

## Musk's 2026 Response

After the files dropped, Musk posted on X:
> "I have never been to any Epstein parties ever and have many times called for the prosecution of those who have committed crimes with Epstein."

> "The acid test for justice is not the release of the files, but rather the prosecution of those who committed heinous crimes with Epstein."

## Verdict
**Extensive Correspondence; Island Visit Unconfirmed.** The 2026 files show Musk and Epstein exchanged at least 16 emails over two years, discussed multiple island visits, and coordinated through assistants. Musk's prior public denials that he barely knew Epstein are contradicted by the warmth and frequency of the correspondence. However, **no evidence of wrongdoing** has emerged, and **no victim has accused Musk**.
