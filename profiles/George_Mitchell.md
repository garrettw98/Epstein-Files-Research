# 🇺🇸 George Mitchell (Former Senate Majority Leader)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / MEETING ATTEMPTS** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
George Mitchell, the former Senate Majority Leader and peace envoy, was another high-profile figure Epstein courted *after* his 2008 conviction.

## The Emails (2010-2013)
*   **The Context**: While many politicians distanced themselves after Epstein's prison stint, emails show continued contact.
*   **The Scheduling**:
    *   **Nov 6, 2013**: An email confirms a scheduled 10:30 AM meeting between Mitchell and Epstein.
    *   **The Topic**: The agenda is unclear, but Epstein often used these meetings to "network" his way back into political relevance.
*   **Phone Logs**: Records show Mitchell returned Epstein's phone calls in 2010.

## The Defense
*   **"Declined or Deflected"**: A spokesperson for Mitchell stated he "declined or deflected" invitations. However, the specific calendar entry for Nov 6, 2013, suggests at least one meeting was formally booked.

## Verdict
**Post-Conviction Target.** Epstein aggressively pursued Mitchell to maintain his political access. Whether the meetings led to any substantive business is unproven, but the attempt to leverage the relationship is verified.
