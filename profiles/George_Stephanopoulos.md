# 📺 George Stephanopoulos (ABC News Anchor)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / DINNER GUEST** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
George Stephanopoulos, one of the most famous news anchors in America and a former top aide to Bill Clinton, was a guest at Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan mansion.

## The Evidence
*   **The Dinner (2010)**: Stephanopoulos attended a dinner party at Epstein's home in December 2010.
    *   *Context*: This was **after** Epstein had served time for soliciting a minor. He was a registered sex offender.
    *   *Guests*: The dinner was held to honor **Prince Andrew**. Other guests included Chelsea Handler and Woody Allen.
*   **The Walk**: After the dinner, Stephanopoulos was photographed walking in Central Park with Epstein and Prince Andrew.

## The Defense
*   **"A Mistake"**: When the photo resurfaced in 2019, Stephanopoulos admitted: *"It was a mistake to go."*
*   **"Not a Friend"**: He claimed he was not friends with Epstein and only attended because of the Prince Andrew connection.

## Significance
Stephanopoulos represents the **media complicity**. While journalists like Vicky Ward were trying to expose Epstein, the anchors of major networks were eating dinner with him. This social coziness helps explain why the story was buried for so long.
