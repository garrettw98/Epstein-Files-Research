# 🥂 Glenn & Eva Dubin

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATES / ACCUSED (Denied)**

Glenn Dubin is a billionaire hedge fund manager (Highbridge Capital). His wife, Eva Andersson-Dubin, is a doctor and former Miss Sweden. They were arguably Epstein's closest social friends.

## The Connection
*   **The Ex-Girlfriend**: Eva dated Jeffrey Epstein for **11 years** before she married Glenn.
*   **The Marriage**: Epstein remained a close family friend even after her marriage.
*   **The Children**: Epstein was named the **godfather** to the Dubins' daughter. He even tried to pressure schools to accept her.

## The Loyalty (Post-Conviction)
*   **The Letter**: In 2008, after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor, Eva wrote a letter to his probation officer calling him an **"honorable man"** and a "role model" for her children.
*   **The Thanksgiving Dinner**: In 2009 (while Epstein was on work release), the Dubins famously held a Thanksgiving dinner at their home. Epstein was a guest.

## The Accusations
*   **Virginia Giuffre**: In unsealed depositions, Giuffre alleged she was sent to the Dubins' house and was "loaned out" to Glenn Dubin for sex.
*   **The Denial**: The Dubins have vehemently denied these allegations, calling them "demonstrably false." They have not been criminally charged.

## Significance
The Dubins represent the **social shield** that protected Epstein. By keeping him in their inner circle after his conviction, they signaled to New York society that his crimes were "not a big deal."
