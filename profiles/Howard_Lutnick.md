# Howard Lutnick

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE** (2026 Revelations)
> **Current Position**: U.S. Secretary of Commerce (Trump Administration)
> **Evidence Level**: **DOCUMENTED** - Flight records, emails, property visits

## Summary

Howard Lutnick is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and BGC Partners, and currently serves as U.S. Secretary of Commerce in the Trump administration. The January 2026 document release revealed he visited Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island with his family, directly contradicting his prior public statements that he had cut ties with Epstein "decades ago."

## The 2026 Revelations

### The Island Visit (December 2012)

Documents released by the DOJ show that in December 2012, Epstein invited Lutnick to his private island in the Caribbean for lunch.

**Key Email Exchange**:
- Epstein's invitation was enthusiastically accepted by **Allison Lutnick** (Howard's wife)
- She confirmed they would arrive **on a yacht with their children**
- This was a family visit to Epstein's island—not a brief business meeting

### Earlier Contact (2011)

- In 2011, the two men "had drinks" together
- That same year, **Epstein contributed to a philanthropic dinner honoring Lutnick**

### Neighborly Relations (2010)

- Emails from 2010 show the two men discussing **construction of a building across the street from both of their homes**
- This indicates they were neighbors and had an ongoing relationship

## The Contradiction

### Public Statements vs. Documents

| What Lutnick Said | What Documents Show |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Cut ties with Epstein decades ago" (2025 interview) | Island visit in 2012 (with family) |
| Distanced himself from associations | Philanthropic ties in 2011 |
| Implied minimal contact | Neighborly emails in 2010 |

### The Timeline Problem

Epstein's 2008 conviction was widely publicized. Lutnick's documented contacts (2010, 2011, 2012) all occurred **after** Epstein was a registered sex offender.

## Response

As of the document release (January 31, 2026), **Lutnick did not respond** to requests for comment.

## NFL Investigation

The NFL announced on February 3, 2026 that it would **look into Lutnick's association with Epstein**. Lutnick is a co-owner of the New York Giants (along with Steve Tisch, who also appears in the files).

## Political Implications

As a sitting Cabinet member in the Trump administration, these revelations carry significant political weight:

- **Confirmation Context**: These documents were not public during Lutnick's confirmation process
- **Administration Response**: The White House has not commented on the revelations
- **Bipartisan Scrutiny**: Both parties have expressed interest in the Epstein files' contents

## Key Documents

| Document Type | Date | Content |
|--------------|------|---------|
| Email | Dec 2012 | Island lunch invitation |
| Email | Dec 2012 | Allison Lutnick's acceptance (yacht, children) |
| Email | 2010 | Construction discussion |
| Records | 2011 | Philanthropic dinner contribution |
