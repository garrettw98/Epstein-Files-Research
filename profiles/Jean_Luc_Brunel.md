# 🇫🇷 Jean-Luc Brunel

> **Role**: **The Scout / Modeling Agent**
> **Status**: **DECEASED** (Suicide in Prison, 2022)

## The Connection
Jean-Luc Brunel was a powerful French modeling agent and the founder of **MC2 Model Management**. He was Epstein's primary "scout" for international victims.

## The Pipeline
*   **The Promise**: Brunel would promise young girls in Eastern Europe and South America modeling careers in the U.S.
*   **The Visa**: He would secure them visas to come to the United States.
*   **The Trap**: Once in the U.S., many were housed in apartments owned by Epstein or his associates and coerced into the "massage" scheme to pay off their "debts" or secure work.

## The Accusations
*   **Virginia Giuffre**: Alleged she was trafficked to Brunel by Epstein and forced to have sex with him.
*   **Multiple Victims**: Dutch and French models accused him of drugging and raping them.

## The End
*   **Arrest**: Arrested in Paris in December 2020.
*   **Charges**: Rape of minors and human trafficking.
*   **Death**: Found hanging in his cell in La Santé Prison (Paris) in February 2022, awaiting trial. Like Epstein, his death was ruled a suicide, closing the criminal case against him.

## February 2026: Co-Conspirator Designation Unredacted

On **February 9, 2026**, the DOJ **formally unredacted** Brunel's name from an FBI document listing Epstein's co-conspirators. The document — a 20-person list that had originally shown only Epstein and Maxwell's names — was unredacted after pressure from Rep. **Thomas Massie** (R-KY) during a live CNN appearance with Kaitlan Collins and a public social media exchange with Deputy AG **Todd Blanche**.

The unredacted document explicitly labels Brunel as a **"co-conspirator"** alongside Ghislaine Maxwell, Les Wexner, and Lesley Groff. While Brunel's involvement was well-known and he had been charged in France before his death, this marks the first time the FBI formally designated him as a co-conspirator in U.S. documents made available to the public.
