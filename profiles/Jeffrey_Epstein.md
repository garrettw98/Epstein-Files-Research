# 🔴 Jeffrey Epstein

> **Status**: **CONVICTED / DECEASED** (Evidence Level: ✓ VERIFIED)

## Who Was He?
Jeffrey Epstein (1953–2019) was a financier who claimed to manage money for billionaires, though his only major confirmed client was **Les Wexner** (founder of Victoria's Secret). He rose from humble beginnings in Brooklyn to become a teacher at the Dalton School, then a trader at Bear Stearns, before starting his own mysterious firm.

## The Crimes
Epstein operated a sophisticated sex trafficking pyramid scheme.
*   **The Method**: He would hire underage girls for "massages," molest them, and then pay them to recruit their friends.
*   **The Scale**: Hundreds of victims have been identified.
*   **The Locations**: Abuse occurred at his homes in Palm Beach, New York, New Mexico, and the Virgin Islands.

## Legal History
### 2008: The "Sweetheart Deal"
*   Investigated in Florida for abusing dozens of girls.
*   Federal prosecutors (led by Alexander Acosta) drafted a 53-page indictment.
*   **The Plea**: Instead of federal prison, he pleaded guilty to lesser state prostitution charges.
*   **Sentence**: 13 months in county jail (with "work release" allowing him to leave for 12 hours a day).
*   **Immunity**: A secret deal gave immunity to "any potential co-conspirators."

### 2019: The End
*   Arrested in July 2019 by SDNY federal prosecutors on sex trafficking charges.
*   Denied bail.
*   Found dead in his cell on August 10, 2019.

## The Money Mystery
*   **Net Worth**: Estimated at ~$600 million at death.
*   **Source**: Remains largely unclear. He did not operate like a traditional fund manager.
*   **JPMorgan & Deutsche Bank**: Paid nearly **$370 million** in settlements (2023) for ignoring red flags to keep him as a client.

## The Ideology (2026 Revelation)
For years, Epstein was viewed as a hedonist. New emails released in Jan 2026 suggest he was an **ideologue**.
*   **"Extreme Zionist" Views**: Emails to Mega Group members reveal he viewed his eugenics program as a way to "strengthen the Jewish bloodline" against demographic threats.
*   **The Mission**: He didn't just collect scientists for fun; he was trying to build a genetic legacy.
