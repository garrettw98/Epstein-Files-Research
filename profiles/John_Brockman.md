# 🧬 John Brockman (The Science Broker)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / THE CONNECTOR**

If Ghislaine Maxwell brought the Royalty, John Brockman brought the Brains.

## The Role
John Brockman was a literary agent for the world's top scientists and the founder of the **Edge Foundation** (Edge.org). He represented Nobel Prize winners and tech titans.

## The "Billionaire's Dinner"
*   **The Scheme**: Brockman hosted exclusive dinners where he introduced his "starving scientist" clients to "billionaire donors"—specifically Jeffrey Epstein.
*   **The Introduction**: Brockman is the link who introduced Epstein to:
    *   **Stephen Hawking**
    *   **Marvin Minsky** (MIT AI Pioneer)
    *   **Steven Pinker** (Psychologist)
    *   **George Church** (Geneticist)
    *   **Murray Gell-Mann** (Nobel Physicist / Santa Fe Institute)
    *   **Lawrence Krauss** (Origins Project)

## The Motivation
*   **For Brockman**: Epstein provided funding for his foundation and his clients.
*   **For Epstein**: Brockman provided "intellectual laundering." Hanging out with Nobel Prize winners distracted from his "sex offender" status.

## The Fallout
After Epstein's arrest, Brockman faced intense scrutiny for continuing to facilitate these meetings long after Epstein's 2008 conviction. He stepped down as CEO of the Edge Foundation in 2019.
