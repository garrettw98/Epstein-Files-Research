# ⚖️ Kathryn Ruemmler (White House Counsel)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / PROFESSIONAL** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Kathryn Ruemmler served as White House Counsel to President Obama (2011-2014) and later became a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs. Her relationship with Epstein was professional but surprisingly warm.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)
*   **"Adoration" Emails**: In email exchanges from 2015-2017 (after she left the White House), Ruemmler expresses warm sentiments, with one subject line reading "Adoration."
    *   *Context*: She was representing the Gates Foundation and other high-profile clients at the time.
*   **Travel**: Records indicate she traveled with Epstein to Paris in 2015 and visited his private island.
*   **The "Godfather" Role**: Epstein recommended her to other billionaires as a legal "fixer."

## #MeToo Crisis Fixer (2017-2019)

The 2026 files revealed Ruemmler's role as Epstein's go-to lawyer for men facing sexual misconduct allegations:

### "Six of These"
In an **April 2018** email, Epstein told Tom Pritzker about architect Richard Meier (accused of harassment):
> *"I assume your buddy richard meier has counsel. kathy ruemmmler has done 6 of these now for me."*

This confirmed Ruemmler had handled **at least six** #MeToo-related crises for Epstein's associates.

### Weinstein Exchange
In an **October 10, 2017** email about Harvey Weinstein, Ruemmler wrote:
> *"Whoever was not harassed by Harvey Weinstein must feel offended! Jesus!"*

Epstein replied:
> *"No worry, that means only grandmothers. Wait, its not all out yet."*

### Bannon Legal Consultation
In **April 2019**, Epstein emailed Ruemmler:
> *"bannon thinks I should hire burk and spiro to deal with civil? thoughts."*

### Backup Estate Executor
Ruemmler was listed as a **backup executor** in Epstein's **2019 version of his will** — demonstrating extraordinary trust.

## Gifts and Compensation

The files document lavish gifts from Epstein to Ruemmler:
- **$9,400 Hermes handbag**
- Met with Epstein **dozens of times** between 2014 and 2019
- Meetings included *"lunches and dinners with celebrities, apartment hunting, and personal beauty appointments"*
- Addressed Epstein as **"Uncle Jeffrey"** in emails

## Goldman Sachs Fallout

Ruemmler now serves as **Chief Legal Officer** at Goldman Sachs:
- At the firm's **2026 annual partner gathering** in Miami, executives expressed **"unease"** about her Epstein ties
- Goldman publicly defended Ruemmler, but Bloomberg reported internal tension
- Ruemmler called questions about her emails **"gratuitous and offensive"**
- **Feb 12, 2026**: Ruemmler announced she will step down as Goldman Sachs CLO effective **June 30, 2026**.

## The Defense
Ruemmler has stated she had a professional relationship with Epstein regarding mutual clients (like Bill Gates) and regrets the association. She denies knowing about his ongoing criminal activities at the time.

## Verdict
**Professional Enabler / Crisis Fixer.** Ruemmler represents the **legitimization** of Epstein. A former White House Counsel traveled with him, advised his associates through #MeToo crises, received lavish gifts, was named in his will, and called him "Uncle Jeffrey." Her position at Goldman Sachs is now under scrutiny.
