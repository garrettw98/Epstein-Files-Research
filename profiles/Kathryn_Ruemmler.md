# ⚖️ Kathryn Ruemmler (White House Counsel)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / PROFESSIONAL** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Kathryn Ruemmler served as White House Counsel to President Obama (2011-2014) and later became a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs. Her relationship with Epstein was professional but surprisingly warm.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)
*   **"Adoration" Emails**: In email exchanges from 2015-2017 (after she left the White House), Ruemmler expresses warm sentiments, with one subject line reading "Adoration."
    *   *Context*: She was representing the Gates Foundation and other high-profile clients at the time.
*   **Travel**: Records indicate she traveled with Epstein to Paris in 2015 and visited his private island.
*   **The "Godfather" Role**: Epstein recommended her to other billionaires as a legal "fixer."

## The Defense
Ruemmler has stated she had a professional relationship with Epstein regarding mutual clients (like Bill Gates) and regrets the association. She denies knowing about his ongoing criminal activities at the time.

## Significance
Ruemmler represents the **legitimization** of Epstein. Even after his 2008 conviction, a former White House Counsel felt comfortable traveling with him, signaling to others that he was "safe" to do business with.
