# 📺 Katie Couric (TV Journalist)

> **Status**: **SOCIAL ACQUAINTANCE** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Katie Couric, the pioneering TV journalist and former anchor of CBS Evening News, exchanged emails with Jeffrey Epstein and attended social events at his Manhattan townhouse -- all **after** his 2008 conviction.

## Key Evidence

### The Dinner Emails (2010)
*   Couric emailed about **stopping by Epstein's house** in 2010.
*   She thanked him for dinner and his **"ROCKIN" lasagna**, describing the guest list as an **"eclectic crowd."**
*   *Context*: This was two years after Epstein's release from jail as a convicted sex offender. The casual, warm tone of the emails suggests a comfortable social relationship, not a reluctant acquaintance.

### The Tea Invitation
*   Epstein invited Couric for tea; she declined.
*   Epstein told her that he and **"Andrew"** (Prince Andrew) were **disappointed** she couldn't attend.
*   *Significance*: Epstein name-dropped royalty to lure a major journalist into his social orbit, a classic technique he used across his network.

### The Peggy Siegal Email (2011)
*   In **2011**, Couric emailed publicist **Peggy Siegal**: **"Oy, thanks for the Jeffrey Epstein invite... it's brought me a world of trouble!"**
*   *Translation*: By 2011, Couric recognized that her association with Epstein was becoming a liability -- but the email also confirms she had been receiving and accepting invitations routed through Siegal.

## The Defense

### 2021 Memoir
*   In her 2021 memoir, Couric described the atmosphere at Epstein's home as **"creepy."**
*   She said she **"should have done a little more research"** before attending.
*   *Critique*: As one of America's most prominent investigative journalists, the claim that she didn't "research" a convicted sex offender before dining at his home has drawn significant skepticism.

## Verdict
**Social Acquaintance.** Couric dined with Epstein after his conviction, exchanged friendly emails, and received invitations through his social network. No evidence links her to any wrongdoing. However, her presence at his home -- as a journalist of her stature -- contributed to the normalization that allowed Epstein to rehabilitate his image. Her own 2011 email acknowledges the relationship "brought me a world of trouble."
