# 💰 Leon Black (Apollo Global Management)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / FINANCIAL PATRON**
> **Significance**: Paid Epstein **$158 million**, effectively funding his post-conviction life.

## The Connection
Leon Black is a billionaire private equity titan and co-founder of Apollo Global Management. He was one of the few people who stuck by Epstein after the 2008 sex crimes conviction.

## The Money ($158 Million)
Between 2012 and 2017, Black paid Epstein a staggering **$158 million**.
*   **The Explanation**: Black claimed Epstein provided "unique" and "genius" advice on trust and estate planning that saved him over **$2 billion** in taxes.
*   **The Skepticism**: Financial experts have questioned how a college dropout (Epstein) could provide tax advice worth that amount, far exceeding what top law firms charge.
*   **The Investigation**: An independent review commissioned by Apollo found "no evidence" that Black knew about Epstein's criminal activities, but confirmed the payments.

## The Fallout
*   **Resignation**: The revelation of the payments forced Black to resign as CEO of Apollo in 2021.
*   **Accusations**: A former Russian model, **Guzel Ganieva**, accused Black of sexual assault and claimed he introduced her to Epstein. Black admitted to a consensual affair but vehemently denied the assault and the Epstein introduction claims.

## Verdict
**The Post-2008 Bankroll.** While Les Wexner funded the *early* years, Leon Black's money funded the *later* years. Without this $158 million, Epstein's operation might have collapsed financially after he became a pariah.
