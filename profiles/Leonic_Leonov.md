## Who Is He?

Very little is publicly known about Leonic Leonov. His name was among six redacted names in the Epstein files that were revealed by members of Congress after reviewing unredacted versions of the documents at the Department of Justice.

The surname "Leonov" is a common **Russian** surname, suggesting possible Russian nationality. However, Rep. Khanna and Rep. Massie stated they could not immediately determine the nationalities of all six individuals. They noted the group included at least one U.S. citizen and one foreigner, with "three or four" others whose nationalities were unclear.

## The Connection to Epstein

Leonov's name appeared in the DOJ's Epstein files in a document that was **redacted** in the public release. Reps. Massie and Khanna described all six redacted individuals as "likely incriminated" by their inclusion in the files.

Leonov appears in only **one document** on the DOJ's 20-person list that had been heavily redacted.

### Feb 11 Caveat (DOJ/CBS Reporting)

CBS News reported a DOJ spokesperson said four newly publicized names, including Leonov, appear once in one file and do not appear to directly implicate those men in criminal conduct.

## How His Name Was Revealed

On **February 10, 2026**, Rep. **Ro Khanna** (D-CA) read Leonov's name on the **House floor** as one of six men whose names were "wrongfully redacted" from the Epstein files. Khanna used the protection of the Constitution's **Speech or Debate Clause** to disclose the names without legal liability.

## Important Caveats

- Being named in the Epstein files does not constitute evidence of criminal activity
- No criminal charges have been filed against Leonov in connection with Epstein
- Almost no public information exists about this individual
- The nature and extent of any relationship with Epstein remain unknown
