# 👙 Les Wexner (Founder of Victoria's Secret)

> **Status**: **THE PATRON / "DECEIVED" CLIENT**
> **Significance**: The primary source of Jeffrey Epstein's initial wealth and status.

## The Connection
In the 1980s, Leslie Wexner was the richest man in Ohio and a retail titan (The Limited, Victoria's Secret). Jeffrey Epstein, a college dropout, somehow became his closest advisor.

## The "Power of Attorney" (1991)
In an unprecedented move, Wexner gave Epstein **full Power of Attorney** over his financial and legal affairs.
*   **The Power**: This allowed Epstein to sign checks, buy/sell property, and hire people on Wexner's behalf without checking with him.
*   **The Result**: Epstein used this power to embed himself in high society, posing as a billionaire when he was really just spending Wexner's money.

## The Asset Transfers
Epstein didn't just "manage" the money; he acquired it.
*   **The Mansion**: The 9 East 71st Street townhouse (largest in NYC) was owned by Wexner. It was transferred to Epstein for **$0** (deed records show no cash exchange).
*   **The Jet**: The original Boeing 727 ("Lolita Express") was previously associated with Wexner's companies.
*   **The "Headhunter" Cover**: Epstein used his connection to Victoria's Secret to pose as a talent scout, recruiting victims with the promise of modeling contracts.

## The Breakup (2007)
Wexner claims he severed ties with Epstein in 2007.
*   **The Accusation**: Wexner alleges he discovered Epstein had "misappropriated" huge sums of money (reported to be over **$46 million**).
*   **The Mystery**: Despite this theft, Wexner **did not sue** Epstein and did not go to the police. He simply quietly cut ties.
*   **2026 Update**: Emails from the transparency release show Epstein and Wexner's lawyers discussing the structure of "The Trust" as early as 2006, specifically mentioning strategies to protect assets from "potential liabilities" and "gold diggers" (a derogatory term often used for accusers).

## Verdict
**The Enabler.** Without Les Wexner's money, jet, and houses, Jeffrey Epstein would have just been a creep in a suit. Wexner's patronage built the empire that facilitated the crimes.
