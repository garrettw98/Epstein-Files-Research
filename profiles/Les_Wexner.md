# 👙 Les Wexner (Founder of Victoria's Secret)

> **Status**: **THE PATRON / "DECEIVED" CLIENT**
> **Significance**: The primary source of Jeffrey Epstein's initial wealth and status.

## The Connection
In the 1980s, Leslie Wexner was the richest man in Ohio and a retail titan (The Limited, Victoria's Secret). Jeffrey Epstein, a college dropout, somehow became his closest advisor.

## The "Power of Attorney" (1991)
In an unprecedented move, Wexner gave Epstein **full Power of Attorney** over his financial and legal affairs.
*   **The Power**: This allowed Epstein to sign checks, buy/sell property, and hire people on Wexner's behalf without checking with him.
*   **The Result**: Epstein used this power to embed himself in high society, posing as a billionaire when he was really just spending Wexner's money.

## The Asset Transfers
Epstein didn't just "manage" the money; he acquired it.
*   **The Mansion**: The 9 East 71st Street townhouse (largest in NYC) was owned by Wexner. It was transferred to Epstein for **$0** (deed records show no cash exchange).
*   **The Jet**: The original Boeing 727 ("Lolita Express") was previously associated with Wexner's companies.
*   **The "Headhunter" Cover**: Epstein used his connection to Victoria's Secret to pose as a talent scout, recruiting victims with the promise of modeling contracts.

## The Breakup (2007)
Wexner claims he severed ties with Epstein in 2007.
*   **The Accusation**: Wexner alleges he discovered Epstein had "misappropriated" huge sums of money (reported to be over **$46 million**).
*   **The Mystery**: Despite this theft, Wexner **did not sue** Epstein and did not go to the police. He simply quietly cut ties.
*   **2026 Update**: Emails from the transparency release show Epstein and Wexner's lawyers discussing the structure of "The Trust" as early as 2006, specifically mentioning strategies to protect assets from "potential liabilities" and "gold diggers" (a derogatory term often used for accusers).

## 2026 Revelations

### House Oversight Subpoena (January 2026)

The House Oversight Committee voted to **subpoena Les Wexner** to testify about his ties to Epstein:
- Testimony scheduled for **February 18, 2026**
- Also subpoenaed Epstein's estate co-executors **Darren Indyke** and **Richard Kahn**
- Wexner's legal representative said he **"will cooperate fully with any governmental inquiry into Epstein"**

### FBI Co-Conspirators List (2019)

An internal FBI email from July 2019 listed Wexner among Epstein's **"10 co-conspirators"**, alongside:
- Ghislaine Maxwell
- Jean-Luc Brunel
- Lesley Groff
- Others (names redacted)

A separate FBI document from August 2019 (five days after Epstein's death) listed **eight "suspected co-conspirators"**, with most names and faces redacted except Maxwell and Brunel.

### FBI Subpoena Attempt (2019)

The FBI attempted to serve Wexner with a subpoena in 2019:
- In a **July 12, 2019 memo**, FBI agents wrote that Wexner's attorneys were trying to hire a criminal defense attorney
- He was **"possibly willing"** to be interviewed by the FBI

### Victoria's Secret Aided Epstein's Defense (2006)

An Oregon attorney general's investigation revealed that Victoria's Secret **directly aided Epstein's legal defense** in 2006:
- The company voluntarily provided intelligence **against one of Epstein's accusers** who had worked for Victoria's Secret
- This suggests organizational knowledge of Epstein's legal troubles extended beyond Wexner personally

## February 9-10, 2026: The Unredaction Battle

### Co-Conspirator Designation Formally Unredacted

On **February 9, 2026**, the DOJ **formally unredacted** Wexner's name from the FBI's co-conspirator list after pressure from Rep. **Thomas Massie** (R-KY). The document had originally listed 20 individuals, with only Epstein and Maxwell's names visible. After Massie's live CNN appearance with **Kaitlan Collins** and a public social media exchange with Deputy AG **Todd Blanche**, the DOJ unredacted **16 of the 18 hidden names**, including Wexner's.

Blanche stated on social media that the DOJ had "unredacted Les Wexner's name from this document," noting he was already mentioned in the Epstein documents "thousands of times." He described Wexner as having been referenced nearly **200 times** across the files.

The unredacted document explicitly labels Wexner as a **"co-conspirator"** alongside Ghislaine Maxwell, Lesley Groff, and Jean-Luc Brunel.

### Named on House Floor (Feb 10, 2026)

Rep. **Ro Khanna** (D-CA) named Wexner on the **House floor** as one of six "powerful men" whose names had been "wrongfully redacted" from the Epstein files. Khanna was protected by the Constitution's **Speech or Debate Clause**.

### Wexner's Response

A legal representative for Wexner stated: **"Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target in any respect."** The representative emphasized that Wexner had been identified as an "information source, not a target" and had "cooperated fully" in 2019.

## Verdict
**The Enabler.** Without Les Wexner's money, jet, and houses, Jeffrey Epstein would have just been a creep in a suit. Wexner's patronage built the empire that facilitated the crimes. The 2026 revelations — the FBI co-conspirators list, the failed subpoena attempt, the congressional compelled testimony, and the formal unredaction of his co-conspirator designation — raise new questions about whether Wexner was merely "deceived" or more deeply involved.
