# 📞 Lesley Groff

> **Role**: **Executive Assistant / "Office Mother"**
> **Status**: **NEVER CHARGED**

## The Role
Lesley Groff was Epstein’s executive assistant for 20 years. She worked out of the Manhattan townhouse and managed his entire life—business, travel, and "social" appointments.

## Key Allegations (Verified Documents)
*   **Logistics**: Groff booked the flights (tickets for victims to fly from Florida to New York or New Mexico) and managed the cash flow.
*   **2026 Update (The "Gatekeeper")**: Unsealed files explicitly describe Groff as the "Gatekeeper" who controlled access to Epstein. Witnesses testified she managed the "flow of girls" into the office, ensuring they didn't cross paths with high-profile business guests.
*   **The "Comfort" Role**: Victims testified that Groff acted as a "motherly" figure in the office, making them feel safe and comfortable before sending them into the room with Epstein.
    *   *Significance*: This "normalization" made it harder for victims to realize they were being trafficked.

## The Evidence
*   **The Black Book**: She managed the contact list.
*   **FedEx Records**: She coordinated the shipping of packages to victims (often cash or lingerie).
*   **2008 Investigation**: She was investigated but, unlike Kellen and Marcinkova, she was often viewed more as "staff" by prosecutors at the time. However, she was included in the broad immunity of the 2008 deal.

## February 9-10, 2026: Co-Conspirator Designation Unredacted

On **February 9, 2026**, the DOJ **formally unredacted** Groff's name from an FBI document listing Epstein's co-conspirators. The document had originally listed 20 individuals, with only Epstein and Maxwell's names visible. After pressure from Rep. **Thomas Massie** (R-KY) during a live CNN appearance and a public social media exchange with Deputy AG **Todd Blanche**, the DOJ unredacted **16 of the 18 hidden names**, including Groff's.

The unredacted document explicitly labels Groff as a **"co-conspirator"** alongside Ghislaine Maxwell, Les Wexner, and Jean-Luc Brunel.

### Groff's Response

Attorney **Michael Bachner**, representing Groff, stated:

> "Lesley has never seen this document and was unaware of it. In fact, neither Lesley nor her counsel were ever notified that she was considered a co-conspirator. On the contrary, after Lesley voluntarily spoke with prosecutors, and answered each and every question asked of her, she was told that she was not being prosecuted."

## Post-Epstein Life
*   **Defense**: Her lawyers have vehemently denied she knew about the sexual abuse, portraying her as a loyal secretary who just managed a busy billionaire's schedule.
*   **Current Status**: She lives in Connecticut. She has not been charged, though she was named as a co-conspirator in the original 2008 federal indictment draft that was never filed — and her co-conspirator designation was formally confirmed in the February 2026 unredaction.
