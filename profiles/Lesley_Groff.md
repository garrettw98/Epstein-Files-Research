# 📞 Lesley Groff

> **Role**: **Executive Assistant / "Office Mother"**
> **Status**: **NEVER CHARGED**

## The Role
Lesley Groff was Epstein’s executive assistant for 20 years. She worked out of the Manhattan townhouse and managed his entire life—business, travel, and "social" appointments.

## Key Allegations (Verified Documents)
*   **Logistics**: Groff booked the flights (tickets for victims to fly from Florida to New York or New Mexico) and managed the cash flow.
*   **The "Comfort" Role**: Victims testified that Groff acted as a "motherly" figure in the office, making them feel safe and comfortable before sending them into the room with Epstein.
    *   *Significance*: This "normalization" made it harder for victims to realize they were being trafficked.
*   **Communication**: Emails show her coordinating directly with Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein regarding the movement of girls.

## The Evidence
*   **The Black Book**: She managed the contact list.
*   **FedEx Records**: She coordinated the shipping of packages to victims (often cash or lingerie).
*   **2008 Investigation**: She was investigated but, unlike Kellen and Marcinkova, she was often viewed more as "staff" by prosecutors at the time. However, she was included in the broad immunity of the 2008 deal.

## Post-Epstein Life
*   **Defense**: Her lawyers have vehemently denied she knew about the sexual abuse, portraying her as a loyal secretary who just managed a busy billionaire's schedule.
*   **Current Status**: She lives in Connecticut. She has not been charged, though she was named as a co-conspirator in the original 2008 federal indictment draft that was never filed.
