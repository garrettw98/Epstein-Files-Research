# 🎨 Maria Farmer

> **Role**: **The First Whistleblower**
> **Significance**: Reported Epstein and Maxwell to the FBI in **1996**, decades before his arrest.

## The Story
Maria Farmer was a young artist hired to work for Epstein. In 1996, she alleges she was assaulted by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Les Wexner's property in Ohio.

## The 1996 Report (The Lost Chance)
*   **The Report**: Farmer fled the property and went straight to the authorities. She filed a report with the NYPD and contacted the FBI.
*   **The Response**: Nothing happened. She claims she was told by authorities that Epstein was "above their pay grade."
*   **The Threat**: She alleges Ghislaine Maxwell threatened her family, saying, "We will destroy you."

## The "Media Room" Witness
Farmer is a crucial witness for the "Tapes" theory.
*   She testified that she saw a **monitoring room** in the Manhattan townhouse filled with television screens showing the bedrooms and bathrooms.
*   She described seeing "piles of tapes" in a safe.

## Why She Matters
Maria Farmer proves that the authorities knew about Epstein **23 years before he was finally stopped**. Her story highlights the systemic failure (or protection) that allowed the abuse to continue for decades.
