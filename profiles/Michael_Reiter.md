# Michael Reiter (Former Palm Beach Police Chief)

> **Status**: **EARLY INVESTIGATIVE FIGURE**

## Summary

Michael Reiter was the Palm Beach police chief who initiated and pushed the early local investigation into Epstein in 2005. In this repository, he represents the local-investigation track that preceded (and conflicted with) later plea-era federal outcomes.

## Timeline Role

- **2005**: Reiter's department launched the Palm Beach case, sometimes referred to as "Operation 12-20" in repository narratives.
- Built victim/witness groundwork and evidentiary momentum before federal plea negotiations reshaped case trajectory.

## Why This Matters

- Establishes that actionable local investigative work existed before the final federal non-prosecution framework.
- Supports the repo's recurring local-vs-federal enforcement contrast.
