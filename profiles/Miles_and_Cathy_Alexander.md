# 🌵 Miles & Cathy Alexander: The Zorro Ranch Managers

> **Status**: **KEY WITNESSES / STAFF**

While Juan Alessi ran Palm Beach, Miles and Cathy Alexander ran the New Mexico outpost (**Zorro Ranch**).

## The Role
*   **Property Managers**: They lived on the property for years.
*   **The "Main House"**: They managed the daily operations of the massive mansion.

## The Testimony
*   **The "Computer" Room**: They confirmed the existence of the high-tech surveillance/server room.
*   **The Visitors**: They saw the scientists and the "models" arriving.
*   **The "Scrub"**: Questions remain about what they saw during the days leading up to the 2019 raid when the servers were allegedly wiped.

## Significance
They represent the "Western" arm of the operation. Their testimony (given to the FBI) likely provided the map for the raid on the ranch.
