## The Role
Nadia Marcinkova, a Slovakian model often referred to as "Global Girl" or the "Yugoslavian Girl" in flight logs, was a constant presence in Epstein's inner circle.

## Key Allegations (Verified Documents)
*   **The Pilot**: Marcinkova obtained her pilot's license (funded by Epstein) and reportedly flew the "Lolita Express" on several occasions.
*   **Active Participation**: Victims have testified that Marcinkova was not just an employee but a participant in the sexual acts.
    *   **Specifics**: Testimony describes her engaging in sex acts with Epstein *while* minors were present or participating in group acts.
*   **Recruitment**: Alleged to have scouted girls in Eastern Europe for Epstein's "modeling" agency.

## The Evidence
*   **Flight Logs**: She appears on the manifest for **90+ flights**.
*   **The "Slave" Contract**: Unverified reports (often cited in tabloids but not fully authenticated in court) suggest she may have signed a "slavery" contract with Epstein, blurring the line between victim and perpetrator.
*   **The Immunity**: Like Kellen, she was explicitly named in the 2008 NPA and granted immunity from federal prosecution.

## Post-Epstein Life
*   **Aviation**: She continued to work in aviation and started her own company, **Aviloop**.
*   **Silence**: She has successfully avoided the media spotlight and has never been criminally charged.
