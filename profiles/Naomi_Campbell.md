# 🇬🇧 Naomi Campbell (Supermodel)

> **Status**: **MENTIONED / FLIGHT LOGS** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Naomi Campbell, the British supermodel and one of the original "Big Six" supermodels, has appeared in the Epstein files through flight logs, police interview transcripts, and photographs with Ghislaine Maxwell.

## Key Evidence

### Police Interview Notes
*   Campbell is referenced in **police interview notes from an Epstein victim**, who described going to Epstein's island with **"Jean Luc"** (Jean-Luc Brunel, Epstein's modeling agent) and **"older people."**
*   *Context*: Campbell's presence on the island alongside Brunel -- who was later charged with rape of minors and human trafficking before dying in prison -- places her in the immediate orbit of the recruitment pipeline.

### Flight Logs
*   Campbell previously appeared on **Epstein's flight logs**, confirming she traveled on his aircraft.

### Social Ties to Maxwell
*   Campbell was a frequent social associate of **Ghislaine Maxwell**.
*   Photographed on Epstein's yacht and at parties.
*   Maxwell attended Campbell's famous **birthday party in India**.

## The Defense
*   Campbell has stated she was **"sickened"** by Epstein's crimes.
*   She previously said: *"I knew him... seemingly everybody knew him,"* but denies knowing about his crimes.

## Verdict
**Documented Social Associate.** Campbell appears in flight logs and is referenced in a victim's police interview. While no victim has accused her of participation in abuse, her presence on the island alongside Brunel and "older people" -- as described by a victim -- places her closer to the operation than a typical dinner guest. Her statement that she was "sickened" is noted.
