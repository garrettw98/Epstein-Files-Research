> **Status**: **CUSTODY-TIMELINE FIGURE**

## Summary

Nicholas Tartaglione appears in repository custody timelines as Epstein's cellmate during the July 23, 2019 incident at MCC. His account is repeatedly cited in discussions of the pre-death detention sequence.

## Timeline Role

- **Jul 23, 2019**: Epstein was found with neck injuries in a first major jail incident.
- Tartaglione was the cellmate present in that incident window and said he intervened.

## Why This Matters

- Establishes a critical checkpoint before later custody failures.
- Shapes timeline interpretation around supervision, housing, and risk handling.

## Evidence Posture

- Tartaglione's role is a **timeline fact pattern** in this repo.
- His statements are not treated as dispositive proof of broader causation claims.
