# Nicola Caputo

> **Role**: **Identity Not Fully Verified / Name Appears in DOJ File**
> **Status**: **NAMED ON HOUSE FLOOR (Feb 10, 2026)**
> **Nationality**: Unconfirmed
> **Position**: Unconfirmed (a public figure with this name served in the European Parliament)

## Who Is He?

Public reporting has identified a name match to an Italian former Member of the European Parliament. However, publicly available files have not yet definitively established that the person in the DOJ document is the same individual.

## The Connection to Epstein

Caputo's name appeared in the Epstein files in a document referenced as **EFTA00077895**. His name was **redacted** by the DOJ in the public release but visible in the unredacted versions reviewed by members of Congress.

Rep. Thomas Massie described one of the six redacted individuals as "pretty high up in a foreign government." It has not been publicly confirmed which of the six he referred to.

## How His Name Was Revealed

On **February 10, 2026**, Rep. **Ro Khanna** (D-CA) read Caputo's name on the **House floor** as one of six men whose names were "wrongfully redacted" from the Epstein files. Khanna was protected from legal liability by the Constitution's **Speech or Debate Clause**.

Caputo appears in only **one document** on the DOJ's 20-person list that had been heavily redacted.

### Feb 11 Caveat (DOJ/CBS Reporting)

CBS News reported a DOJ spokesperson said four newly publicized names, including Caputo, appear once in one file and do not appear to directly implicate those men in criminal conduct.

- No criminal charges have been filed against Caputo in connection with Epstein
- The nature and extent of his relationship with Epstein remain unclear from the currently available documents
