# Nicola Caputo

> **Role**: **European Politician / Epstein Associate**
> **Status**: **NAMED ON HOUSE FLOOR (Feb 10, 2026)**
> **Nationality**: Italian
> **Position**: Former Member of the European Parliament (2014-2019)

## Who Is He?

Nicola Caputo (born March 4, 1966) is an Italian politician who served as a **Member of the European Parliament (MEP)** representing Italy's **Democratic Party** from 2014 to 2019. He is the most politically prominent of the previously unknown names revealed in the February 2026 disclosures.

## The Connection to Epstein

Caputo's name appeared in the Epstein files in a document referenced as **EFTA00077895**. His name was **redacted** by the DOJ in the public release but visible in the unredacted versions reviewed by members of Congress.

Rep. Thomas Massie described one of the six redacted individuals as "pretty high up in a foreign government." While it has not been confirmed whether this description referred specifically to Caputo, his status as a former MEP makes him the most likely match for this characterization among the six names.

## How His Name Was Revealed

On **February 10, 2026**, Rep. **Ro Khanna** (D-CA) read Caputo's name on the **House floor** as one of six men whose names were "wrongfully redacted" from the Epstein files. Khanna was protected from legal liability by the Constitution's **Speech or Debate Clause**.

Caputo appears in only **one document** on the DOJ's 20-person list that had been heavily redacted.

## Important Caveats

- Being named in the Epstein files does not constitute evidence of criminal activity
- No criminal charges have been filed against Caputo in connection with Epstein
- The nature and extent of his relationship with Epstein remain unclear from the currently available documents
