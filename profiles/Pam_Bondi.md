# Pam Bondi (U.S. Attorney General)

> **Status**: **GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL**
> **Role in Repo**: Release governance, congressional oversight testimony

## Summary

Pam Bondi is the U.S. Attorney General in the 2025-2026 transparency phase of the Epstein files process. In this repository, she is a central figure in release sequencing, redaction disputes, and congressional oversight hearings.

## Key Timeline

- **Feb 27, 2025**: DOJ OPA published "first phase" declassified-file release language under Bondi's office.
- **Jan 30, 2026**: DOJ announced publication of 3.5 million responsive pages in compliance with the Transparency Act.
- **Feb 11, 2026**: Bondi testified before the House Judiciary Committee for more than five hours and was questioned by members of both parties.
- **Feb 12, 2026**: AP reported a dispute over DOJ logging of congressional file-portal searches; Bondi denied ordering monitoring and defended DOJ process.

## Hearing-Era Issues

During the Feb 11, 2026 hearing cycle, questioning focused on:
- Redaction and unredaction criteria,
- Whether additional names would be unredacted,
- DOJ release sequencing and compliance claims,
- Survivor privacy failures during publication,
- Tension between statements about "pending investigations" and no-new-prosecution messaging from other DOJ officials.

## What Is Documented vs Unresolved

### Documented
- Bondi was the listed witness at the House Judiciary oversight hearing on Feb 11, 2026.
- DOJ release actions and public statements occurred under her department's authority.

### Unresolved/Disputed
- Whether release and redaction choices were primarily operational constraints, legal constraints, or strategic policy decisions.
- Whether process decisions materially affected congressional oversight quality.
