# ⚕️ Peter Attia (Longevity Doctor)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / DOCTOR** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Dr. Peter Attia is a celebrity physician known for his work on longevity ("Outlive"). The 2026 email release exposed a deeply personal and crude relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

## The Evidence (1,700 Mentions)
*   **Volume**: Attia's name appears over **1,700 times** in the Epstein files.
*   **The "Fresh Shipment"**: In 2015, Epstein emailed Attia a photo of a young woman with the subject line "Got a fresh shipment."
    *   *Attia's Response*: Instead of reporting it, he replied with "crude, tasteless banter."
*   **The "LSJ" Reference**: Emails explicitly mention **"LSJ"** (Little St. James), suggesting Attia was aware of the island and its significance, despite later claiming ignorance.
*   **The "Withdrawal"**: Attia wrote to Epstein's assistant: *"I go into JE withdrawal when I don't see him."*

## The "Doctor" Role
*   **Denial**: Attia denies being Epstein's "doctor," claiming he only answered general questions.
*   **The Reality**: He met Epstein **7-8 times** at the Manhattan townhouse and stayed in an Epstein-owned apartment in Jan 2016.

## The Fallout
*   **Apology**: Attia issued a lengthy apology on X, calling his behavior "indefensible" and "naïve."
*   **Career**: CBS News severed ties with him as a contributor. He resigned as Chief Science Officer of David Protein.

## Significance
Attia represents the "Health" wing of Epstein's influence. Epstein used doctors like Attia to seek life extension (transhumanism) while simultaneously pulling them into his web of complicity via "locker room" bonding.
