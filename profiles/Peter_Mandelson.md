# 🇬🇧 Peter Mandelson (Lord Mandelson)

> **Status**: **CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Peter Mandelson is a prominent British politician — architect of "New Labour," former cabinet minister, former EU Trade Commissioner, and former British Ambassador to the United States. The 2026 files revealed he shared confidential UK government documents with Epstein and received payments totaling ~$75,000.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### Financial Payments

Bank statements from **2003 and 2004** — years when Mandelson was a Labour MP and later EU Trade Commissioner — show:
- **Three payments of $25,000** (~£19,800 each) from Epstein's accounts to entities linked to Mandelson or his husband, **Reinaldo Avila da Silva**
- A **2009 payment of £10,000** (~$13,200) from Epstein to fund an osteopathy course for da Silva (this was previously admitted by Mandelson, who called it a "lapse in collective judgment")

Total known payments: **~$88,200** (£68,400)

### Sharing of State Secrets

The files reveal multiple instances of Mandelson allegedly forwarding confidential government information to Epstein:

| Date | Alleged Leak |
|------|-------------|
| **June 13, 2009** | Leaked a Downing Street document proposing **£20bn of asset sales** and Labour's tax policy plans |
| **December 2009** | Suggested JPMorgan CEO **Jamie Dimon** should "mildly threaten" Chancellor **Alistair Darling** over a bankers' bonus tax |
| **March 31, 2010** | Forwarded **confidential minutes** of a meeting between Chancellor Darling and NEC Director **Larry Summers** |
| **April 1, 2010** | Forwarded additional meeting minutes **two minutes after receiving them** |
| **May 9, 2010** | Gave Epstein **advance notice** of a **€500 billion EU bailout** to save the Euro |

### Post-Conviction Contact
Like Prince Andrew, Mandelson maintained contact *after* Epstein's 2008 conviction, staying at his Paris apartment.

## The Fallout

### Resignation from Labour Party
**February 1, 2026**: Mandelson resigned his Labour Party membership.
> *"While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party."*

### Resignation from House of Lords
**February 4, 2026**: Mandelson formally resigned from the **House of Lords** — the first such resignation linked to misconduct since 1917.

### Criminal Investigation
The **Metropolitan Police** confirmed they launched a criminal investigation into a "72-year-old man" on **suspicion of misconduct in public office**.

### PM Starmer's Response
Prime Minister **Keir Starmer**:
- Had sacked Mandelson as US Ambassador in **September 2025** after initial Epstein ties surfaced
- Told his Cabinet he was **"appalled"** by the revelations
- Is seeking **emergency legislation** to strip Mandelson of his noble title

## Mandelson's Denials

In his resignation letter:
> *"Allegations which I believe to be false that he made financial payments to me 20 years ago, and of which I have no record or recollection, need investigating by me."*

In a **BBC interview (January 2026)**:
- Said he had **never seen young women or girls** at Epstein's properties
- Said he was **unaware** of Epstein's sexual crimes

## The Implications
This is one of the most serious cases in the Epstein files — a senior government official allegedly:
1. **Received payments** from a convicted sex offender
2. **Shared state secrets** that could be used for market manipulation
3. **Maintained the relationship** after Epstein's conviction
4. Now faces **criminal prosecution**

## Verdict
**Under Criminal Investigation.** The most consequential political fallout from the 2026 files outside the United States. Mandelson has resigned from his party, the House of Lords, and faces prosecution for misconduct in public office.
