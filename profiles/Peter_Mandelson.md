# 🇬🇧 Peter Mandelson (Lord Mandelson)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / FINANCIAL TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Peter Mandelson is a prominent British politician (Labour Party) and former cabinet minister who was known to associate with Epstein. The 2026 files significantly deepen this connection.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)
*   **Government Info**: A series of emails from 2009-2011 suggest Mandelson shared non-public information about **UK economic policy** and **banking regulations** with Epstein.
    *   *Quote*: "J, The PM is going to announce [Redacted] tomorrow. Position accordingly."
*   **Payments**: Financial records show consulting fees paid from Epstein's "Southern Trust" to a shell company linked to Mandelson.
*   **The "Post-Jail" Support**: Like Prince Andrew, Mandelson maintained contact *after* Epstein's 2008 conviction, staying at his Paris apartment.

## The Implications
This is one of the few instances where Epstein appears to be **monetizing** his political connections for direct financial gain (insider trading/market moves), rather than just social status.

## Defense
Mandelson has previously claimed his relationship was strictly social and that he "regrets" the association. He has not yet commented on the specific 2026 emails regarding government info.
