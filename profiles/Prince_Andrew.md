# 👑 Prince Andrew, Duke of York

> **Status**: **ACCUSED / SETTLED** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Prince Andrew was a long-time friend of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. He was photographed with Epstein in Central Park in 2010, *after* Epstein's first conviction.

## The Accusations
**Virginia Giuffre (Victim)** alleged in court documents that she was trafficked to Prince Andrew on three separate occasions when she was 17 years old:
1.  In London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's home).
2.  In New York (at Epstein's mansion).
3.  On Little St. James Island.

## Key Evidence
*   **The Photograph**: A widely circulated photo shows Prince Andrew with his arm around a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, with Ghislaine Maxwell standing in the background.
*   **The "Circled" Name**: Epstein's butler, **Alfredo Rodriguez**, circled Andrew's name in the "Black Book" as a key witness/associate.
*   **Flight Logs**: Confirm his presence at various Epstein properties.
*   **2026 Revelation**: Emails released in Jan 2026 confirm he attended an "intimate dinner party" with Epstein *after* Epstein was released from jail, contradicting his claims that he cut ties.
    *   *Security Detail*: The emails show Epstein's staff coordinating with Royal Protection officers for this visit, proving it was a planned, formal event rather than a "casual drop-in" to break up the friendship.

## The Defense
*   **"No Sweat"**: In a disastrous 2019 interview, he claimed he could not have sweated on the dance floor (as Giuffre described) due to a medical condition from the Falklands War.
*   **"Never Met Her"**: He denied ever meeting Giuffre, claiming the photo might be faked.

## The Outcome
*   **Civil Lawsuit**: In February 2022, he settled the sexual abuse lawsuit filed by Giuffre for an undisclosed sum (reported to be ~$16 million). The settlement included no admission of liability.
*   **Royal Duties**: He was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages.
