# 👑 Prince Andrew, Duke of York

> **Status**: **ACCUSED / SETTLED** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

## The Connection
Prince Andrew was a long-time friend of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. He was photographed with Epstein in Central Park in 2010, *after* Epstein's first conviction.

## The Accusations
**Virginia Giuffre (Victim)** alleged in court documents that she was trafficked to Prince Andrew on three separate occasions when she was 17 years old:
1.  In London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's home).
2.  In New York (at Epstein's mansion).
3.  On Little St. James Island.

## Key Evidence
*   **The Photograph**: A widely circulated photo shows Prince Andrew with his arm around a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, with Ghislaine Maxwell standing in the background.
*   **The "Circled" Name**: Epstein's butler, **Alfredo Rodriguez**, circled Andrew's name in the "Black Book" as a key witness/associate.
*   **Flight Logs**: Confirm his presence at various Epstein properties.
*   **2026 Revelation**: Emails released in Jan 2026 confirm he attended an "intimate dinner party" with Epstein *after* Epstein was released from jail, contradicting his claims that he cut ties.
    *   *Security Detail*: The emails show Epstein's staff coordinating with Royal Protection officers for this visit, proving it was a planned, formal event rather than a "casual drop-in" to break up the friendship.

## The Defense
*   **"No Sweat"**: In a disastrous 2019 interview, he claimed he could not have sweated on the dance floor (as Giuffre described) due to a medical condition from the Falklands War.
*   **"Never Met Her"**: He denied ever meeting Giuffre, claiming the photo might be faked.

## The Outcome
*   **Civil Lawsuit**: In February 2022, he settled the sexual abuse lawsuit filed by Giuffre for an undisclosed sum (reported to be ~$16 million). The settlement included no admission of liability.
*   **Royal Duties**: He was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages.
*   **Title Removal**: In late 2025, King Charles III stripped Andrew of his remaining royal titles, including the right to be called "Prince," in an effort to insulate the monarchy from ongoing Epstein revelations.

## 2026 Revelations (January Release)

### The Buckingham Palace Dinner Invitation

Emails show Andrew invited Epstein to dine at **Buckingham Palace** — the official London residence of the late Queen Elizabeth II:

- **September 27, 2010**: Epstein contacts Andrew during a stay in London, writing: *"What time would you like me... we will also need (to)... have private time."*
- Andrew replies he's just leaving Scotland, adding: **"We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy."**
- Two days later: Andrew writes he was **"delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]."**

It is **unclear whether the dinner took place**.

### The 26-Year-Old Russian Woman

- **August 12, 2010**: Epstein emails Andrew (addressed as "The Duke") that he has **"a friend who I think you might enjoy having dinner with"** — a woman who would be in London from August 20-24.
- Andrew asks what Epstein told her about him and whether she would be bringing **"a message"** from Epstein.
- Epstein says the woman was **26, Russian, clever and beautiful**, and that she had the prince's email.
- Andrew replied he would be in Geneva on August 22, but **"would be delighted to see her."**
- **No evidence** that any meeting occurred.

### Second Accuser

A second woman has come forward in 2026, alleging that Epstein **trafficked her to the UK** for sex with Andrew:
- Her lawyer, **Brad Edwards**, told the BBC the encounter occurred at **Royal Lodge** (Andrew's former residence).
- The woman was in her 20s at the time and is not British.
- She was allegedly given a tour of Buckingham Palace and tea after spending the night with Andrew.

### Photos

A photograph released in the January 2026 files shows **Andrew on all fours over a woman**, raising renewed public outrage.

### Post-Conviction Contact

Emails from the 2026 release confirm Andrew attended an **"intimate dinner party"** with Epstein *after* Epstein was released from jail, contradicting Andrew's claims that he cut ties. Epstein's staff coordinated with **Royal Protection officers** for the visit, proving it was a planned, formal event.

## Calls for Testimony

British Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** called on Andrew to testify before Congress on his Epstein ties:
> "Anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they are asked to do that."

Epstein victims have also requested Andrew testify before lawmakers, though he is unlikely to do so.

## Verdict
**Accused / Settled.** Andrew's documented relationship with Epstein — including post-conviction socializing, the Buckingham Palace invitation, and attempts to introduce him to young women — represents one of the deepest and most troubling connections in the files. He settled the Giuffre lawsuit and now faces a second accuser.
