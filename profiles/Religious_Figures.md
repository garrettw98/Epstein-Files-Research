# 🛐 Religious Figures: The Pope & The Dalai Lama

> **Status**: **VERIFIED MEETINGS / DONATION SOLICITATION**

Epstein collected moral authority figures just as he collected scientists.

## 1. The Dalai Lama
*   **The Mentions**: The Dalai Lama is referenced **150+ times** in Epstein's documents.
*   **The Meeting**: A journalist confirmed seeing the Dalai Lama at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse.
*   **The Purpose**: It appears the Dalai Lama (or his entourage) visited Epstein to solicit donations for his organization. Epstein used this proximity to "launder" his moral reputation.

## 2. Pope John Paul II
*   **The Photo**: A photograph exists of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell meeting Pope John Paul II in 2003 (at a general audience).
*   **The Lie**: In emails, Epstein claimed he "lived with" the Pope. This was almost certainly a fabrication to impress people, but the access was real.

## 3. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (Iran)
*   **The Claim**: An email in the files claims Epstein met with the former Iranian President.
*   **The Denial**: Ahmadinejad's team denied it.
*   **Significance**: Even if false, the fact that Epstein *claimed* it shows he wanted to project influence over not just Western leaders, but their enemies too.

## Significance
By associating with the world's holiest figures, Epstein created a "halo effect." It was a psychological trick: "How can he be a monster if he hangs out with the Dalai Lama?"
