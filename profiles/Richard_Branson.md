# Richard Branson

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE** (2026 Revelations)
> **Position**: Founder, Virgin Group
> **Evidence Level**: **DOCUMENTED** - Email correspondence, island visit
> **Location**: British Virgin Islands (owns Necker Island)

## Summary

Sir Richard Branson is the British billionaire founder of Virgin Group. The January 2026 document release revealed email correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein and at least one meeting on Branson's private island, Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands.

## The 2026 Revelations

### The "Harem" Email (September 2013)

A 2013 email exchange between Branson and Epstein reveals a warm, familiar relationship:

**September 11, 2013 - Branson to Epstein**:
> "It was really nice seeing you yesterday."

And then:
> "Any time you're in the area would love to see you. **As long as you bring your harem!**"

### Context of the Meeting

According to a Virgin Group representative:
- The email was sent **shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting** on Necker Island (Branson's private island)
- Epstein arrived at the meeting **with three adult women**
- Epstein himself referred to these women as his **"harem"**
- The women **did not attend the business meeting**

### The "Harem" Pattern

This email confirms a pattern documented elsewhere in the files:
- Epstein frequently traveled with groups of young women
- He openly referred to them as his "harem"
- Associates normalized this behavior
- Branson's casual use of the term suggests familiarity with Epstein's lifestyle

## Due Diligence and Cutoff

### The Donation Attempt

According to Virgin's statement:
- At some point, Epstein **offered a charity donation** to the Bransons
- The Bransons asked their team to **carry out due diligence** before accepting
- The due diligence **"uncovered serious allegations"**

### The Result

- Virgin Unite (the Bransons' foundation) **did not take the donation**
- Richard and Joan Branson **"decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again"**

### Timeline Question

The statement does not clarify:
- When the donation was offered
- When the due diligence was conducted
- Whether the September 2013 meeting was before or after this cutoff

## Official Statement (February 2026)

A representative for Virgin Group stated:

> "Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings."

### Analysis

| Claim | What Documents Show |
|-------|---------------------|
| "Few occasions" | At least one island visit documented |
| "12 years ago" | 2013 emails confirm timeline |
| "Group or business settings" | Business meeting on Necker Island |
| "Limited" | Familiar tone ("bring your harem") suggests comfort |

## Geographic Proximity

Branson owns **Necker Island** in the British Virgin Islands—the same island chain where Epstein owned **Little St. James** and **Great St. James**.

- Distance between islands: Approximately 40 miles
- Both accessible by helicopter or boat
- The BVI was a hub for Epstein's operations

## Key Points

1. **Post-Conviction Contact**: The 2013 meeting occurred **five years after** Epstein's 2008 conviction
2. **"Harem" Normalization**: Branson casually referenced Epstein's entourage of women
3. **Due Diligence Worked**: Unlike many associates, the Bransons eventually cut ties
4. **Business Context**: Epstein was apparently seeking business/philanthropy access
