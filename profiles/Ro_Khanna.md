> **Status**: **CONGRESSIONAL ACTOR**
> **Role in Repo**: Transparency Act co-author and floor-level disclosure actions

## Summary

Rep. Ro Khanna is a co-author of the Epstein Files Transparency Act and a leading Democratic voice in the 2026 disclosure disputes. In this repository, he is central to congressional pressure over redactions, context gaps, and claims that records were altered before publication.

## Key Timeline

- **2025**: Co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act with Rep. Thomas Massie.
- **Feb 9, 2026**: Reviewed unredacted files in DOJ secure access setting.
- **Feb 10, 2026**: Read six names on the House floor under Speech or Debate protections.
- **Feb 10, 2026**: Asserted that large portions of files remained redacted despite "unredacted" access claims.

## Main Claims and Positions

Khanna publicly argued that:
- DOJ had released only part of what the law contemplated.
- Name/context handling in the release process created interpretive distortion.
- The FBI may have removed or scrubbed relevant statements before DOJ publication (an allegation not fully proven in public record).

## What Is Documented vs Unresolved

### Documented
- Khanna co-authored the law and participated in secure-room review.
- Khanna made floor disclosures under constitutional legislative protections.
- Khanna publicly criticized remaining redaction levels and contextual disclosure quality.

### Unresolved/Disputed
- Khanna's scrubbing allegation remains a serious but unresolved claim without complete public evidentiary chain.
- The full before/after document audit trail for disputed records is not publicly complete.
