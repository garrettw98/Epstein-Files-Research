# Salvatore Nuara

> **Role**: **Alleged Law Enforcement Contact**
> **Status**: **NAMED ON HOUSE FLOOR (Feb 10, 2026)**
> **Nationality**: United States
> **Background**: Retired NYPD detective; Huntington Station, New York

## Who Is He?

Salvatore "Sal" Nuara is a retired NYPD detective, approximately 76 years old, from Huntington Station, New York. His name appears in **Epstein's "Little Black Book"** — the contact list maintained by Epstein's staff that contained the names and phone numbers of hundreds of associates, friends, and alleged victims.

## The Connection to Epstein

Nuara's name was among six names that were **redacted** by the DOJ in the publicly released Epstein files but visible in the unredacted versions reviewed by members of Congress.

### Black Book Entry

His name appears in the original **Epstein black book** — the contact list that was stolen by Epstein's former butler **Alfredo Rodriguez** and later turned over to authorities.

### NYPD Disciplinary History

Nuara was investigated and ultimately **disciplined** by the NYPD for his connection to an **escort service**. This discipline was not directly related to the Epstein investigation, but it establishes a pattern of involvement with sex work adjacent to Epstein's orbit.

### Alleged Role

Based on his law enforcement background and his presence in Epstein's contact network, researchers have speculated that Nuara may have served as a **"corruption vector"** — a law enforcement insider who could provide advance warning about investigations or police interest in Epstein's activities. This remains unverified speculation.

## How His Name Was Revealed

On **February 10, 2026**, Rep. **Ro Khanna** (D-CA) named Nuara as one of six men whose identities were "wrongfully redacted" from the publicly released Epstein files. Khanna read the names on the **House floor**, protected by the Constitution's **Speech or Debate Clause**.

Nuara appears in only **one document** on the DOJ's 20-person list that had been heavily redacted.

### Feb 11 Caveat (DOJ/CBS Reporting)

CBS News reported a DOJ spokesperson said four newly publicized names, including Nuara, appear once in one file and do not appear to directly implicate those men in criminal conduct.
