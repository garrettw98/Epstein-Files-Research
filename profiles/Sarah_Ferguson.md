# 👑 Sarah Ferguson (Duchess of York)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / FINANCIAL RECIPIENT**

While Prince Andrew is the headline, his ex-wife "Fergie" also had a direct financial relationship with Epstein.

## The Debt
In 2010, Sarah Ferguson was in deep financial trouble (on the verge of bankruptcy).
*   **The Payment**: Jeffrey Epstein stepped in and paid off **£15,000** of her debts.
*   **The Intervention**: Prince Andrew reportedly coordinated the help.

## The Admission
After the scandal broke, Ferguson issued a public apology:
*   *"I deeply regret that Jeffrey Epstein became involved in any way with me... It was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf."*

## The Significance
This payment proves that Epstein's utility to the Royal Family wasn't just social; he was a **financial fixer** for their embarrassing problems. This "debt" may explain why Prince Andrew felt he couldn't cut ties with Epstein even after the 2008 conviction.
