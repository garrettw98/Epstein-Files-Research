# 📋 Sarah Kellen (Sarah Kensington)

> **Role**: **The "Lieutenant" / Scheduler**
> **Status**: **GRANTED IMMUNITY** (2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement)

## The Role
If Ghislaine Maxwell was the partner, Sarah Kellen was the Operations Manager. She worked as Epstein’s executive assistant and scheduler for over a decade.

## Key Allegations (Verified Documents)
*   **The "Scheduler"**: Kellen maintained the "massage" appointment books. She was the primary contact point for the victims, calling them to set up times for abuse.
*   **The Recruiter**: Victims testified that Kellen would instruct them to bring friends and would pay out the referral bonuses.
*   **The Near-Arrest (2007)**: Police records released in 2026 confirm that Palm Beach detectives had prepared a probable cause affidavit to arrest Kellen as an "accessory to molestation" in 2007. The arrest was blocked by the federal intervention (Acosta's office) that led to the NPA.
*   **Participation**: Unlike some staff who stayed in the office, victims alleged Kellen was sometimes present during the "massages" or would give instructions on what Epstein liked.
*   **The "Vibe Control"**: One victim testified that Kellen would "train" girls on how to act around Epstein to avoid upsetting him.

## The Evidence
*   **The Scheduling Book**: Her handwriting is all over the logs seized by police, marking "massages" alongside business meetings.
*   **The 2008 NPA**: Kellen is explicitly named as a "potential co-conspirator" in the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement, granting her total federal immunity.
*   **The Deposition**: When deposed in 2016, she invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination hundreds of times.

## Post-Epstein Life
*   **Rebranding**: She changed her name to **Sarah Kensington**.
*   **Career**: She started an interior design business and wrote a self-help blog.
*   **Current Status**: She lives a wealthy private life in New York/Connecticut. Despite being named by dozens of victims, the 2008 immunity deal has protected her from federal prosecution.
