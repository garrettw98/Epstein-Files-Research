# 🏊‍♀️ Sarah Ransome: The Escape Artist

> **Role**: **SURVIVOR / AUTHOR**
> **Significance**: Her attempted escape proves the "imprisonment" aspect of the island.

## The Story
Sarah Ransome was a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC when she was recruited. She spent months in Epstein's orbit, including time on Little St. James.

## The Escape Attempt
*   **The Location**: Little St. James Island.
*   **The Act**: Desperate to leave, Ransome stole a quad bike, drove it to the shore, and attempted to **swim to St. Thomas** (miles away across open ocean).
*   **The Capture**: She was intercepted by Epstein's staff before she could get far.
*   **The Punishment**: She describes having her passport confiscated and being locked in her room for days.

## The "Suicide" Attempt
*   **The Jump**: In New York, she attempted to jump off a balcony to escape the pressure and threats from the Epstein network.
*   **The Injury**: She survived but sustained serious injuries that left her permanently disabled (she often walks with a cane).

## The Book: "Silenced"
Ransome wrote a memoir detailing the sophisticated psychological manipulation used by Ghislaine Maxwell. She argues that Maxwell was the "CEO" of the operation, often more controlling than Epstein himself.

## Why She Matters
Defense attorneys often argue that women "stayed" for the money or lifestyle. Ransome’s desperate attempts to flee—risking drowning and death—shatter that narrative. She proves it was a prison.
