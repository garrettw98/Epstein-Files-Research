## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### Maxwell Communications (2003)
Brin exchanged messages with **Ghislaine Maxwell**, including offering to bring along Google's then-CEO **Eric Schmidt** to a dinner at Epstein's New York residence. This was **before** Epstein's 2008 conviction.

A **2011 email** listed approximately 30 confirmed attendees for a planned dinner, with **Brin, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk** among those listed.

### Island Allegations
Epstein accuser **Sarah Ransome** claimed in **2024 court documents** that she met Brin and his then-fiancee, **Anne Wojcicki**, on Epstein's private island.

## Response
Brin has **not publicly commented** on his appearance in the 2026 files. Google did not respond to requests for comment.

## Context
Brin is one of several **Silicon Valley figures** whose names appear in the files, alongside Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Reid Hoffman. The documents reveal Epstein maintained deeper and wider tech industry connections than previously known, with emails showing contact with at least **20 prominent tech executives, investors, and researchers**.

## Verdict
**Documented Social Associate.** Brin communicated with Maxwell, appeared on guest lists, and has been placed on Epstein's island by an accuser. However, no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against Brin in connection with Epstein's crimes.
