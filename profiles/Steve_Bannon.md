# 🎙️ Steve Bannon (Former White House Strategist)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / MEDIA TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
The January 2026 document release revealed a surprisingly deep professional relationship between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein, primarily centered around a potential documentary project.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)
*   **The Interviews**: The release includes transcripts and footage from approximately **15 hours of interviews** Bannon conducted with Epstein in 2019 (shortly before Epstein's arrest).
    *   **Purpose**: Allegedly for a documentary about Epstein's life and finances.
    *   **Content**: Epstein discusses his philosophy on money, science, and "genetic improvement" (eugenics).
*   **Media Training**: Emails suggest Bannon provided informal media coaching to Epstein.
*   **Gifts**: A "thank you" note from Bannon references a gift sent by Epstein (described as a "rare book").

## The Interview Quotes (2019)
Transcripts from the 15 hours of footage reveal a candid, often combative dynamic:
*   **On Criminality**:
    *   *Bannon*: "Tier one's the highest and worst? ... You're the lowest. Okay, tier one, you're the lowest, but a criminal."
    *   *Epstein*: "Yes."
*   **On World Leaders**:
    *   *Epstein*: "World leaders are politicians in general. They're not scientists, they're not intellectuals, they're not great thinkers."
*   **On PR Strategy**: Texts show them plotting to change the narrative.
    *   *Epstein*: "Decide how to deal with the pervert hermit image and fill the box with another narrative."
    *   *Bannon*: "We must counter 'rapist who traffics in female children'... that can't be redeemed."
*   **On Cyber Warfare**: In 2018, they discussed using **"zero-day exploits"** to target and drain cryptocurrency wallets, suggesting an interest in offensive cyber capabilities.

## The Context
Bannon has stated he was interested in Epstein's financial knowledge and his connections to the global elite, viewing him as a key to understanding the "deep state" mechanics he frequently criticizes. Critics argue the relationship legitimized Epstein during a time he was seeking reputation rehabilitation.

## 2026: Text Message Revelations

### Trump-Related Messages

The January 2026 release included **hundreds of text messages and emails** between Bannon and Epstein:

**Mocking Trump's Intelligence**:
- Bannon called Trump **"a moron"** and **"the worst negotiator in human history"**
- Said Trump had **"lost it"**
- Michael Wolff (passing info to Epstein) called Trump **"an idiot"**
- They repeatedly mocked Trump's claim of being **"a very stable genius"**

**Boasting About Influence**:
- Bannon texted: **"Dude: I just got him to pull the trigger on $400 billion in tariffs on China"**

**Rumors About Trump and an Aide**:
- In texts from **December 2018 and January 2019**, Epstein asked Bannon about aide **Madeleine Westerhout**
- Bannon described her as the "receptionist" and a "good kid"
- The White House called this **"a salacious and false rumor that has been proven to be fiction"**

### The Border Wall Texts

In a **May 25, 2019** text exchange, Bannon bragged to Epstein about his private border wall effort near El Paso:
> **"I also can't seem like I'm running Trump's nose in his own incompetence."**

Bannon later faced federal criminal charges over the private border wall, but was **pardoned by Trump**.

### Gifts from Epstein

Emails from late 2018 show Bannon and his son received **Hermes Apple Watches** from Epstein as gifts, valued at **$1,499 each**.

### The Documentary

Bannon also interviewed Epstein on video in 2019 for a documentary he was filming called **"The Monsters: Epstein's Life Among the Global Elite."**

### The March 2018 Meeting

Documents show a March 2018 email from Epstein's office inviting former Obama White House Counsel **Kathryn Ruemmler** to a get-together with:
- Jeffrey Epstein
- Steve Bannon
- **Miroslav Lajcak** (Slovak diplomat who later resigned over his Epstein ties)

This places Bannon at meetings with both Republican and Democratic political operatives in Epstein's network.

### Bannon's Role in Narrative Management

The text messages reinforce that Bannon was actively helping Epstein manage his public image:
- Strategy discussions on countering negative coverage
- Planning alternative narratives
- Media outreach coordination

## The Bannon-Epstein Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2018 | Text messages, meeting with Ruemmler/Lajcak |
| Early 2019 | 15 hours of interviews conducted |
| July 2019 | Epstein arrested |
| Aug 2019 | Epstein dies |
| Jan 2026 | Full correspondence released |

## Verdict
**Documented Professional Association.** Bannon sought Epstein for content/info; Epstein sought Bannon for influence. No evidence suggests Bannon participated in sexual misconduct.

The 2026 text messages reveal a closer, more casual relationship than previously known, including private jokes about the sitting president.
