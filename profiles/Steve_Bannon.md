# 🎙️ Steve Bannon (Former White House Strategist)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / MEDIA TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
The January 2026 document release revealed a surprisingly deep professional relationship between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein, primarily centered around a potential documentary project.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)
*   **The Interviews**: The release includes transcripts and footage from approximately **15 hours of interviews** Bannon conducted with Epstein in 2019 (shortly before Epstein's arrest).
    *   **Purpose**: Allegedly for a documentary about Epstein's life and finances.
    *   **Content**: Epstein discusses his philosophy on money, science, and "genetic improvement" (eugenics).
*   **Media Training**: Emails suggest Bannon provided informal media coaching to Epstein.
*   **Gifts**: A "thank you" note from Bannon references a gift sent by Epstein (described as a "rare book").

## The Interview Quotes (2019)
Transcripts from the 15 hours of footage reveal a candid, often combative dynamic:
*   **On Criminality**:
    *   *Bannon*: "Tier one's the highest and worst? ... You're the lowest. Okay, tier one, you're the lowest, but a criminal."
    *   *Epstein*: "Yes."
*   **On World Leaders**:
    *   *Epstein*: "World leaders are politicians in general. They're not scientists, they're not intellectuals, they're not great thinkers."
*   **On PR Strategy**: Texts show them plotting to change the narrative.
    *   *Epstein*: "Decide how to deal with the pervert hermit image and fill the box with another narrative."
    *   *Bannon*: "We must counter 'rapist who traffics in female children'... that can't be redeemed."

## The Context
Bannon has stated he was interested in Epstein's financial knowledge and his connections to the global elite, viewing him as a key to understanding the "deep state" mechanics he frequently criticizes. Critics argue the relationship legitimized Epstein during a time he was seeking reputation rehabilitation.

## Verdict
**Documented Professional Association.** Bannon sought Epstein for content/info; Epstein sought Bannon for influence. No evidence suggests Bannon participated in sexual misconduct.
