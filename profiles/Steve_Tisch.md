## Summary

Steve Tisch is the co-owner of the New York Giants, an Oscar-winning film producer ("Forrest Gump"), and a major philanthropist. The January 2026 document release revealed extensive email correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein discussing women, island invitations, and requests to move conversations off the record.

## The 2026 Revelations

### Email Correspondence About Women

The released documents show Tisch and Epstein frequently exchanged emails about women:

**The "Ukrainian Girl" Exchange (2013)**:
- Tisch asked Epstein for details about a "Ukrainian Girl" who had lunch with him after meeting at Epstein's house
- Tisch called her a "very sweet girl"
- Epstein replied that the woman had **"a 10 ass"** and is a **"character"**
- Epstein said he would get "all info" on her

**The "Pro or Civilian" Questions**:
- On **more than one occasion**, Tisch used slang terms to ask Epstein if a woman he was describing was a **sex worker** ("pro") or not ("civilian")
- This language suggests a pattern of discussing women's sexual availability

### Attempt to Avoid Records

**April 2013 Exchange**:
- Epstein asked Tisch to **send him his phone number**
- Reason given: He **"did not want a record"** of the conversations
- This suggests awareness that their written communications could be problematic

### Island Invitations

- Emails show Epstein **inviting Tisch to his private island**
- Tisch claims he never accepted these invitations

### Football Game Invitations

- Tisch invited Epstein to a **New York Giants football game**
- Shows the relationship was reciprocal

## Tisch's Response

In a statement following the release, Tisch said:

> "We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with."

### Analysis of Response

| Claim | Context |
|-------|---------|
| "Brief association" | Emails span multiple years (2010-2013+) |
| "Adult women" | Does not address the nature of discussions |
| "Never went to island" | Documents don't contradict this specific claim |
| "Deeply regret" | Standard post-revelation response |

## NFL Investigation

The **NFL announced on Monday, February 3, 2026** that it will look into Tisch's association with Epstein.

- Tisch is subject to NFL conduct policies as an owner
- Fellow Giants co-owner **Howard Lutnick** is also under scrutiny
- This marks the first time the NFL has investigated owners over Epstein connections

## Tufts University Connection

Tisch is a major donor to Tufts University:
- Multiple campus buildings bear the Tisch name
- The Tufts Daily published analysis of the Epstein correspondence
- No statement from Tufts as of February 2026

## Key Documents Summary

| Date | Type | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| 2013 | Email | "Ukrainian Girl" discussion |
| 2013 | Email | "10 ass" reply from Epstein |
| Multiple | Emails | "Pro or civilian" inquiries |
| April 2013 | Email | Request to move off record |
| Various | Emails | Island invitations |
| Various | Emails | Giants game invitations |

## The Language Pattern

The emails reveal a specific vocabulary:
- **"Pro"** - Sex worker
- **"Civilian"** - Non-sex worker
- **"All info"** - Detailed personal information about women
- Ratings of women's physical attributes

This language suggests Epstein's network discussed women as commodities.
