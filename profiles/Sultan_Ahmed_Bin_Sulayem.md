# Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem

> **Role**: **Emirati Businessman / Email Correspondent**
> **Status**: **NAMED ON HOUSE FLOOR (Feb 10, 2026)**
> **Nationality**: United Arab Emirates
> **Position**: Former Chairman and Group CEO, DP World (stepped down Feb 13, 2026)

## Who Is He?

Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem is a prominent Emirati businessman who served as Chairman and Group CEO of **DP World**, one of the world's largest port and logistics companies, headquartered in Dubai. DP World operates in over 40 countries and handles roughly 10% of global container trade.

## The Connection to Epstein

Bin Sulayem appears **over 4,700 times** in the Epstein files released by the DOJ. He was a friend of Epstein's who maintained a relationship with the convicted sex offender for years **after** Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting an underage prostitute.

## The "Torture Video" Email

The most notorious document linking Bin Sulayem to Epstein is an **April 24, 2009 email** in which Epstein wrote:

> "where are you? are you ok, I loved the torture video"

The recipient's name and email address were **redacted** by the DOJ in the public release. However, Deputy Attorney General **Todd Blanche** confirmed on social media that the recipient was identified in file **EFTA00666117**, which names "Sultan Bin Sulayem."

## The Email Correspondence

The DOJ documents show that Epstein and Bin Sulayem exchanged **dozens or possibly hundreds of emails** over several years. The correspondence included:

- **Business discussions** and travel plans
- **Highly personal conversations** including descriptions of sexual encounters
- **References to escorts**, with Bin Sulayem allegedly sharing details about women
- **Social gatherings** and event planning

## How His Name Was Revealed

### Step 1: Massie's Social Media Pressure (Feb 9, 2026)

Rep. **Thomas Massie** (R-KY), after reviewing unredacted files at the DOJ, posted on social media referencing the "torture video" email and asking why the recipient's name was redacted. He described the individual as a "sultan."

### Step 2: Blanche's Response

Deputy AG **Todd Blanche** responded on social media, accusing Massie of "grandstanding" and noting that Bin Sulayem's name was already available unredacted in a **separate file** within the Epstein Library. Blanche linked to the email from Sultan Bin Sulayem in that document.

### Step 3: Khanna's House Floor Disclosure (Feb 10, 2026)

Rep. **Ro Khanna** (D-CA) named Bin Sulayem as one of six "powerful men" whose names were redacted from the Epstein files, reading the names on the House floor under the protection of the **Speech or Debate Clause** of the Constitution.

## Context

Massie described one of the six redacted individuals as "pretty high up in a foreign government." While Bin Sulayem is technically a businessman rather than a government official, his role as head of DP World — a company closely tied to the UAE's ruling establishment — places him in the sphere of foreign power.

## Official Response

As of February 10, 2026, neither DP World nor Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem had publicly commented on the disclosures.
