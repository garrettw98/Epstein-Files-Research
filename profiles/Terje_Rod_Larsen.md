# 🇳🇴 Terje Rød-Larsen (Diplomat)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / FINANCIAL RECIPIENT** (Resigned in Disgrace)

## The Connection
Terje Rød-Larsen was a senior Norwegian diplomat and President of the **International Peace Institute (IPI)**. He was a key node in Epstein's international diplomatic network.

## The Evidence
*   **The Personal Loan**: In 2013, Epstein gave Rød-Larsen a **$130,000 personal loan**.
    *   *The Audit*: An audit found this loan was undisclosed to the IPI board.
*   **The Donations**: Epstein funneled **$650,000** to the IPI (the "Mongolian" donation scandal).
*   **The "Racist" Email**: In 2015, Rød-Larsen sent Epstein an email with a derogatory phrase ("kill the Indian first"), revealing a comfort level with bigotry.

## The "Will" Mystery
*   **The Beneficiaries**: One of the strangest details in the 2026 release is a draft of Epstein's will that allegedly named Rød-Larsen's children as beneficiaries (**$5 million each**).
    *   *Reaction*: Rød-Larsen's family claimed they had no idea about this.

## The Fallout
*   **Resignation**: Rød-Larsen was forced to resign from the IPI in October 2020 after the financial ties were exposed.
*   **Significance**: He was the "Diplomatic" key. Through him, Epstein gained access to the UN circle and international peace brokers.
