*   **The Connection**: A close friend of Bill Clinton, Spacey was a passenger on the famous 2002 Africa humanitarian trip on Epstein's plane.
*   **The Photos**: Spacey was photographed sitting on a "throne" next to Ghislaine Maxwell during a private tour of **Buckingham Palace** (organized by Prince Andrew).
*   **The Allegations**: Spacey has faced his own unrelated sexual assault allegations, but has not been directly accused of participating in Epstein's trafficking ring.

## 2. Naomi Campbell
*   **The Connection**: The supermodel was a frequent social associate of Ghislaine Maxwell.
*   **The Photos**: Photographed on Epstein's yacht and at parties.
*   **The Birthday**: Maxwell attended Campbell's huge birthday party in India.
*   **The Defense**: Campbell has stated: *"I knew him... seemingly everybody knew him,"* but denies knowing about his crimes.

## 3. Chris Tucker
*   **The Connection**: The comedian/actor was also on the 2002 Africa trip with Clinton.
*   **The Defense**: Tucker claimed he didn't know who Epstein was and was just there for the Clinton Foundation work. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

## 4. Woody Allen

*   **The 2026 Revelation**: Emails show Epstein inviting Allen to a "day museum White House trip."
*   **The "Castle Dracula" Letter**: Allen wrote a birthday note to Epstein, joking that his townhouse was like "Castle Dracula" but praising the "interesting people" he met there (referencing Prince Andrew and scientists).
*   **The Dinner**: Allen attended monthly dinner parties at Epstein's townhouse for years.
*   **The Favor**: Emails reveal Epstein used his influence with Bard College President **Leon Botstein** to help Allen's daughter secure admission to the school.
*   **The Quote**: Allen famously said of Epstein's situation: *"I'm sensitive to it because I've been the object of that kind of scrutiny myself."*

## Significance
These celebrities provided **camouflage**. When Epstein traveled with Oscar winners and Supermodels, it made it harder for anyone to question the "young assistants" traveling with them.
