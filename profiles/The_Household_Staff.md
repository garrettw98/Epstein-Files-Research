# 🧹 The Household Staff: The "Invisible" Witnesses

> **Status**: **KEY WITNESSES / POLICE INFORMANTS**

While the "Lieutenants" (Sarah Kellen, etc.) were participating in the abuse, the cleaning staff, house managers, and pilots were watching everything. Their testimony provides the most unvarnished look at the daily operations.

## 1. Juan Alessi (House Manager)
*   **Role**: Managed the Palm Beach property (1990-2002).
*   **Testimony**:
    *   He confirmed **Prince Andrew** stayed in the guest bedroom for weeks at a time.
    *   He testified that Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson received "massages" (though he didn't witness sexual acts with them directly).
    *   He described the "system": "The girls would come in, I would let them in, they would go to the massage room."

## 2. Alfredo Rodriguez (The Butler)
*   **Role**: House manager/Butler.
*   **The "Black Book"**: Rodriguez is the reason we have the "Little Black Book."
    *   *The Theft*: He photocopied the book and tried to sell it to an attorney in 2009 for $50,000.
    *   *The FBI*: The FBI raided him, seized the book, and it became the roadmap for the entire investigation.
*   **The Circled Names**: Rodriguez circled roughly 38 names he claimed were "material witnesses" or "in cahoots." Verified circled names include:
    *   **Donald Trump**
    *   **Prince Andrew**
    *   **Ehud Barak** (Israeli PM)
*   **Death**: He died in 2015, long before the 2019 arrest.

## 3. The Pilots: David Rodgers & Larry Visoski
*   **Role**: Flew the Boeing 727 ("Lolita Express") and other aircraft for decades.
*   **The Logs**: They were required by FAA law to keep logs. These logs are the "Flight Manifests" we reference today.
*   **Testimony**:
    *   **Visoski** testified in the Maxwell trial (2021). He confirmed flying **Bill Clinton**, **Donald Trump**, **Kevin Spacey**, and **Prince Andrew**.
    *   **Crucial Detail**: Visoski testified that the cockpit door was always closed, so he "didn't see" what happened in the cabin, but he confirmed the passengers.

## Significance
These men were "the help." Epstein ignored them, thinking they were invisible. In the end, their logbooks and stolen photocopies became the evidence that destroyed him.
