# 💼 The Executors: Darren Indyke & Richard Kahn

> **Status**: **COOPERATING WITNESSES** (Settled with USVI)

Jeffrey Epstein didn't sign every check himself. For decades, he relied on two lawyers who served as his business brain.

## The Roles
*   **Darren Indyke**: Epstein's long-time personal attorney.
    *   *The Job*: He set up the shell companies, managed the real estate, and handled the "non-disclosure agreements" (NDAs) for victims.
    *   *The Trust*: He is a co-executor of the "1953 Trust" (Epstein's estate).
*   **Richard Kahn**: An accountant and attorney.
    *   *The Job*: Managed the tax returns and the day-to-day accounts of the various "non-profits" like Gratitude America.

## The "Captain" of the Enterprise?
In the 2023 USVI lawsuit, the Attorney General argued that Indyke and Kahn were indispensable to the trafficking operation.
*   **The Allegation**: They facilitated the payments to victims, arranged the visas (with Brunel), and structured the finances to hide the crimes.
*   **The Marriage**: Indyke was so close to Epstein that Epstein reportedly paid for his wedding.

## The Settlement
*   **The Deal**: In exchange for settling the lawsuit with the USVI, the estate (run by Indyke and Kahn) agreed to pay **$105 million**.
*   **The Protection**: As part of the settlement, Indyke and Kahn were **released from liability** regarding the racketeering charges, provided they cooperated and turned over documents.
*   **Current Status**: They remain the executors of the estate, responsible for liquidating Epstein's assets (selling the islands, the planes) and paying out claims to victims. They are the "last men standing."
