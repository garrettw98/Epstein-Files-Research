# 🇳🇴 Thorbjorn Jagland (Former Norwegian Prime Minister)

> **Status**: **CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION** (Evidence Level: ● SUBSTANTIAL - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Thorbjorn Jagland is one of Norway's most prominent political figures: former Prime Minister (1996-97), Foreign Affairs Minister (2000-01), President of the Storting (Norwegian parliament), Secretary General of the Council of Europe, and Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The January 2026 document release revealed a deep personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that has triggered a criminal investigation by Norway's economic crime authority.

## Key Positions Held

| Role | Period |
|------|--------|
| Prime Minister of Norway | 1996-1997 |
| Foreign Affairs Minister | 2000-2001 |
| President of the Storting | 2005-2009 |
| Chairman, Norwegian Nobel Committee | 2009-2015 |
| Secretary General, Council of Europe | 2009-2019 |

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### The Apartment Request
Jagland asked Epstein for **money to buy an apartment** — a direct financial request that crosses the line from social association into potential corruption territory.

### Stays at Epstein Properties
Documents show Jagland stayed with Epstein at multiple locations:
- **New York City** (2018)
- **Paris** (2015 and 2018)

These visits occurred **years after** Epstein's 2008 conviction and well after his status as a sex offender was widely known internationally.

### The "Trump Island" Email (June 2016)
In a June 2016 email, during the US presidential campaign, Jagland wrote to Epstein:

> **"If Trump wins in US I'll settle on your island."**

This email is significant because:
- It references Epstein's private island (Little St. James) in a casual, familiar tone
- It demonstrates Jagland was comfortable enough to joke about living on the island
- It was sent **eight years after** Epstein's conviction

### The Lavrov Meeting Request
Epstein asked Jagland to arrange a meeting with **Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov**:
- This places Epstein in the realm of high-level international diplomacy
- It demonstrates Epstein used associates like Jagland as conduits to foreign heads of state
- The Russia connection aligns with broader patterns of Epstein's [Shadow Diplomacy](../topics/Shadow_Diplomacy.md)

### The Nobel Committee Connection
As Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Jagland had influence over the Nobel Peace Prize. The 2026 files reveal Epstein leveraged this connection to **lobby for Bill Gates to win the Nobel Peace Prize** — offering powerful men tangible, high-value services in exchange for access and legitimacy.

## The Criminal Investigation

### Okokrim Probe
Norway's **Okokrim** (National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime) has opened an **AGGRAVATED CORRUPTION** probe into Jagland.

### The Immunity Question
As a former **Secretary General of the Council of Europe**, Jagland may hold immunity from prosecution:
- Norway is **seeking to revoke** this immunity
- The legal process for stripping immunity from a former Council of Europe head is unprecedented
- The outcome will set a significant legal precedent

### Jagland's Response
Jagland's lawyer has stated that his client is **"calm"** about the investigation — suggesting confidence that immunity protections or other defenses will hold.

## The Pattern
Jagland represents a key node in Epstein's strategy of cultivating **heads of state and international institution leaders**:

1. **Access**: Epstein gained access to the Nobel Committee, the Council of Europe, and Russian foreign policy circles
2. **Financial Entanglement**: The apartment request created potential leverage
3. **Sustained Contact**: Visits spanning years, even after conviction
4. **Mutual Benefit**: Epstein offered financial help; Jagland offered diplomatic access

## Verdict
**Under Criminal Investigation for Aggravated Corruption.** Jagland's case is among the most serious to emerge from the 2026 files. A former prime minister asking a convicted sex offender for money to buy an apartment, staying at his properties across multiple countries, and offering to broker meetings with Russian foreign ministers represents a profound compromise of public office. The immunity question remains unresolved.
