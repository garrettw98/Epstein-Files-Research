# 🏛️ Tom Barrack (Colony Capital / Ambassador)

> **Status**: **ASSOCIATE / DOCUMENTED TIES** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Thomas Barrack is the founder of Colony Capital (now DigitalBridge), a longtime friend and fundraiser for Donald Trump, and has served as US Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy to Syria. The January 2026 document release revealed that Barrack communicated with Jeffrey Epstein through at least 2017 and was connected through Epstein to a network of technology executives, foreign diplomats, and political operatives.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### The Peter Thiel Introduction (July 2016)
In July 2016, Epstein **introduced Barrack to Peter Thiel** at Palantir:
- Thiel is the co-founder of Palantir Technologies and PayPal
- Palantir specializes in surveillance and intelligence technology
- This introduction places Epstein as a connector between Trump's inner circle and Silicon Valley

**August 2016 follow-up**: Epstein wrote to Thiel:
> **"Tom Barrack really liked you."**

This confirms the introduction was successful and that Epstein was actively managing the relationship.

### The Gates / Larry Cohen Meeting (March 2017)
In March 2017, Epstein **encouraged Bill Gates and Larry Cohen to meet Barrack**:
- This demonstrates Epstein's role as a network hub connecting finance, tech, and politics
- Gates was still meeting with Epstein at this time (a fact he later called a "huge mistake")
- The meeting was orchestrated by Epstein to broker high-level political-business connections

### The August 2016 Dinner Schedule
A personalized schedule for **August 2016** documents a dinner with:
- **Tom Barrack**
- **Ehud Barak** (former Israeli Prime Minister)
- **Vitaly Churkin** (Russian diplomat, then Russia's Ambassador to the UN)
- Jeffrey Epstein

This dinner is significant because:
- It occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign (Barrack was chairing Trump's inaugural committee)
- It placed a key Trump ally at a table with the former Israeli PM and Russia's top UN diplomat
- Vitaly Churkin died suddenly in February 2017 at the Russian consulate in New York
- The combination of guests suggests Epstein was facilitating geopolitical networking

### Signal Messaging
Epstein **urged Barrack to download Signal**, the encrypted messaging app:
- Signal messages are end-to-end encrypted and can be set to auto-delete
- This suggests Epstein wanted their communications to be untraceable
- The push for encrypted messaging indicates awareness that their exchanges could be scrutinized

## The Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| July 2016 | Epstein introduces Barrack to Peter Thiel at Palantir |
| Aug 2016 | Epstein writes to Thiel: "Tom Barrack really liked you" |
| Aug 2016 | Dinner scheduled: Barrack, Barak, Churkin, Epstein |
| March 2017 | Epstein encourages Gates/Cohen to meet Barrack |
| Through 2017 | Communications documented between Barrack and Epstein |

## The Political Context
Barrack's role in Trump's orbit makes his Epstein connections politically significant:
- He served as **Chairman of Trump's 2017 Inaugural Committee**
- He was later appointed **US Ambassador to Turkey** and **Special Envoy to Syria**
- His dinner with Ehud Barak and Vitaly Churkin during the campaign season raises questions about the intersection of Epstein's network and political power

## Verdict
**Documented Associate with Political Significance.** Barrack's communications with Epstein through 2017, the Peter Thiel introduction, the Bill Gates/Larry Cohen brokering, and the dinner with Barak and Churkin paint a picture of Epstein as an active intermediary in Barrack's political and business circles. The push for encrypted Signal communications suggests both parties were aware of the sensitivity of their relationship. No allegations of criminal misconduct have been made against Barrack in connection with Epstein.
