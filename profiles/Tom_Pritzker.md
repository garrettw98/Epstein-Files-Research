# 🏨 Tom Pritzker (Hyatt Hotels Executive Chairman)

> **Status**: **ACCUSED / DOCUMENTED TIES** (Evidence Level: ● SUBSTANTIAL - 2026 Release)

## The Connection
Thomas Pritzker is the Executive Chairman of Hyatt Hotels Corporation and president of the Pritzker Family Philanthropic Fund, which oversees the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The January 2026 document release revealed **7,000+ search results** connecting him to Epstein's files — one of the highest volumes of any named individual.

## The Accusation

### Virginia Giuffre's Testimony
Virginia Giuffre accused Tom Pritzker of a sexual encounter in France, describing him as the **"owner of a large hotel chain."**

In her own words:
> **"I believe I was with Tom once."**

### Pritzker's Response
Pritzker **denies the allegations** and has challenged the accuracy of Giuffre's account.

## Key Evidence (2026 Files)

### The Prison Release Email (July 22, 2009)
On the very day Epstein was released from his Florida jail sentence, Pritzker emailed him:

> **"I'm really happy that you are OUT."**

This email is significant because:
- It demonstrates the relationship survived Epstein's conviction
- Pritzker was among the **first to reach out** upon Epstein's release
- The enthusiasm suggests a close personal bond, not merely an acquaintance

### Post-Conviction Social Invitations
Despite Epstein's status as a convicted sex offender, Pritzker **invited Epstein to Pritzker Prize ceremonies** — the most prestigious award in architecture, overseen by the Pritzker family.

- This provided Epstein with access to elite cultural circles post-conviction
- It served as a form of social rehabilitation for Epstein

### The Macron Connection
Emails reference a meeting with **Emmanuel Macron** (then a rising French politician, later President of France) arranged through **Caroline Lang**:
- This places Pritzker and Epstein in overlapping diplomatic/political networks
- The French connection aligns with Giuffre's accusation of an encounter in France

### The Richard Meier / Kathryn Ruemmler Email
Epstein wrote to Pritzker about architect **Richard Meier** needing legal counsel, stating:

> **"Kathy Ruemmler has done 6 of these now for me."**

This email is notable because:
- It suggests Epstein was deploying **Kathryn Ruemmler** (former Obama White House Counsel) as a legal fixer for associates facing allegations
- The phrase "6 of these" implies a **pattern of crisis management**
- It connects Pritzker to the broader legal network Epstein maintained

### Photo Evidence
A previously unreleased photo shows Pritzker at a table with **Ehud Barak**, **Woody Allen**, **David Blaine**, and Epstein — released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.

## The Volume of Evidence
With **7,000+ search results** in the files, Pritzker's name appears with extraordinary frequency. This volume suggests sustained, extensive contact over a long period — not an incidental or casual relationship.

## Verdict
**Accused by Victim; Extensively Documented Associate.** Pritzker is one of the few individuals both accused by Virginia Giuffre and connected through thousands of documents. His prison-release email, post-conviction invitations, and the sheer volume of references in the files indicate a deep and lasting relationship with Epstein. Pritzker denies the sexual allegations.
