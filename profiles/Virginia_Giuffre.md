# 🦋 Virginia Giuffre (née Roberts)

> **Role**: **Survivor / The Catalyst**
> **Significance**: Her relentless civil lawsuits forced the unsealing of the documents we are reading today.

## The Story
Recruited at age 16 while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago (Donald Trump's club), Virginia Giuffre became the central figure in exposing the Epstein ring.

## Key Allegations (Sworn Testimony)
*   **Prince Andrew**: Alleged she was trafficked to him in London, New York, and the USVI. (He settled her lawsuit in 2022).
*   **Alan Dershowitz**: Accused him of abuse (later dropped the claim in a settlement, acknowledging she "may have made a mistake" regarding his identity).
*   **The "Training"**: detailed how Ghislaine Maxwell groomed her to be "perfect" for Epstein's powerful friends.

## The Legal Crusader
Virginia didn't just survive; she fought back.
1.  **2011**: Filed a civil rights lawsuit (dismissed).
2.  **2015**: Sued Ghislaine Maxwell for defamation (*Giuffre v. Maxwell*).
    *   **The Result**: This is the "Rosetta Stone" case. The 2024 document release comes entirely from this lawsuit.
3.  **2021**: Sued Prince Andrew.
    *   **The Result**: A massive settlement and his removal from public royal life.

## Why She Matters
Without Virginia Giuffre, there would be no "Epstein Files." Her refusal to stay silent when the world called her a liar is the only reason the public knows the truth today.
