# 🤖 AI & Neuroscience: Funding the Future Mind

> **Status**: **VERIFIED INVESTMENTS**

Epstein didn't just want to breed a better human (Eugenics); he wanted to build a better mind (AI). His funding of early Artificial Intelligence projects suggests a strategic interest in "Dual-Use" technology.

## 1. MicroPsi 2 (Cognitive AI)
*   **The Project**: An artificial intelligence software designed to model human cognition and emotion.
*   **Epstein's Role**: He provided funding for the research.
*   **The Goal**: To create AI that understands human motivation—a tool that would be incredibly valuable for manipulation or social engineering.

## 2. OpenCog (General AI)
*   **The Project**: An open-source project aiming to build "Artificial General Intelligence" (AGI)—machines that think like humans.
*   **The Funding**: Epstein's foundation supported **Ben Goertzel**, the founder of OpenCog (and the brain behind "Sophia the Robot").
*   **The Connection**: Goertzel admitted to meeting Epstein and receiving funding, arguing that "science is science" regardless of the donor.

## 3. Harvard's "Mind, Brain, and Behavior"
*   **The Committee**: Epstein was a former board member of this prestigious Harvard committee.
*   **The Access**: This position gave him direct access to the latest research in **neuroscience** and **behavioral control**.

## 4. NeuroTV
*   **The Platform**: Epstein funded this online science channel featuring interviews with Nobel laureates in neuroscience (May-Britt and Edvard Moser).
*   **The Strategy**: By controlling the *platform* for scientific discourse, Epstein could shape the narrative and ensure his own access to the guests.

## Significance
Epstein was investing in the two most powerful technologies of the 21st century: **Genetics** (CRISPR/Eugenics) and **Intelligence** (AI). He wasn't just a "money guy"; he was betting on the future of human control.
