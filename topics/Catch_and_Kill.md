# 🗞️ Catch and Kill: Buying Silence

> **Status**: **THEORETICAL / CIRCUMSTANTIAL**

"Catch and Kill" is a media tactic where a publisher buys the exclusive rights to a story not to publish it, but to bury it.

## The National Enquirer Connection
*   **David Pecker**: The CEO of AMI (National Enquirer) was a known associate of both Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.
*   **The Theory**: Critics allege that AMI may have purchased stories from potential Epstein victims to keep them off the market.
*   **The "Safe"**: It was widely rumored that Pecker kept a safe containing damaging stories on his friends. Whether Epstein files were in there remains unproven but highly suspected given their social circle.

## The "Vanity Fair" Kill
*   **The Method**: This wasn't a purchase; it was a pressure campaign. (See [The Media Cover-Up](The_Media_Coverup.md)).
*   **The Result**: The effect is the same. The story dies, and the perpetrator continues.
