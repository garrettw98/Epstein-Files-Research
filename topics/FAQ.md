# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> **Goal**: Simple answers to the most common questions.

## 1. Is there a "Client List"?
**No and Yes.** There is no single sheet of paper titled "Client List."
*   We have **Flight Logs** (passengers).
*   We have the **Black Book** (contacts).
*   We have **Court Documents** (mentions).
*   *Reality*: The internet often conflates these lists. Being in the "Book" does not mean someone was a "Client."

## 2. Why isn't Bill Clinton/Donald Trump in jail?
**Lack of Evidence.**
*   **Clinton**: Flew on the plane, but no victim has accused him of sexual acts in verified court documents.
*   **Trump**: Accused in a 2016 lawsuit (withdrawn with no evidence); witness testimony in 2024 specifically said he was *not* seen on the island.
*   *Reality*: Flying on a plane with a bad man is not a crime. Proving they participated in abuse requires witness testimony or physical evidence, which (currently) does not exist for them.

## 3. Did Elon Musk go to the island?
**No.**
*   Emails show Epstein *invited* him and *wanted* him to visit.
*   Musk claims he never went.
*   There are **no flight logs, photos, or witness testimonies** placing him on the island.

## 4. Is Ghislaine Maxwell talking?
**No.**
*   She is serving a 20-year sentence.
*   She has not cut a cooperation deal with prosecutors. If she were "naming names," we would likely see arrests or sentence reductions. She maintains her innocence (mostly).

## 5. Who inherited Epstein's money?
**The "1953 Trust."**
*   The beneficiaries of this trust are **secret**.
*   It is managed by his lawyers, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn.
*   A large portion (~$150M) went to the **Epstein Victims' Compensation Program** to pay survivors. The rest remains in the trust for unknown purposes.

## 6. Was Epstein a Spy?
**Probable but Unproven.**
*   The connections to **Robert Maxwell** (confirmed spy) and **Carbyne** (Intel tech) are strong.
*   **Alexander Acosta's** comment ("He belongs to intelligence") is the strongest hint.
*   *Verdict*: It is the most logical explanation for his wealth and protection, but no agency has claimed him.
