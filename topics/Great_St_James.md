# 🏝️ Great St. James: The Unfinished Kingdom

> **Status**: **CONSTRUCTION SITE / SEIZED ASSET**
> **Acquired**: 2016 for $22.5 million.

While Little St. James was Epstein's established base, **Great St. James** (a neighboring island) was his expansion project. The plans reveal an ambition to build a much larger, more bizarre compound.

## 1. The Construction Plans
Blueprints submitted to the Virgin Islands government (and later cited in stop-work orders) reveal a massive development:
*   **The Amphitheater**: A classical-style outdoor theater.
*   **The "Underwater Office"**: Plans included a pool complex with an "underwater office," fitting his obsession with submarines and oceanography.
*   **The Compound**: Multiple guest cottages, a surveyor's shed, and a new barge dock to ferry supplies.

## 2. The Legal Battle
*   **The Stop-Work Order**: In December 2018 (months before his arrest), the USVI government issued a stop-work order because Epstein was building without proper permits.
*   **The Violation**: Epstein allegedly ignored the order and continued construction, using "cistern repair" as a cover for expanding the compound.

## Significance
Great St. James proves that Epstein was not "winding down" in 2016-2019. He was **expanding**. He was building a legacy complex that likely would have hosted even larger gatherings (like the Mindshift conferences) had he not been arrested.
