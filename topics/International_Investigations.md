## Poland

### Investigation Announced

**Date**: February 3, 2026
**Announced By**: Prime Minister Donald Tusk

### Tusk's Statement

> "We have decided to establish an analytical group and possibly launch an investigation if the analyses confirm our concerns regarding the paedophilia scandal in the United States. This matter is of great concern to the Polish public because of the so-called Polish elements in this entire affair."

### Focus Areas
