## Poland

### Investigation Announced

**Date**: February 3, 2026
**Announced By**: Prime Minister Donald Tusk

### Tusk's Statement

> "We have decided to establish an analytical group and possibly launch an investigation if the analyses confirm our concerns regarding the paedophilia scandal in the United States. This matter is of great concern to the Polish public because of the so-called Polish elements in this entire affair."

### Focus Areas

1. **Daniel Siad**: Epstein's "scout" who emailed about having "girls" in Kraków
2. **Wire Transfers**: $125,000+ sent to Poland
3. **Visa Applicants**: Polish nationals sponsored by Epstein
4. **Russia Connection**: Possible Epstein ties to Moscow

### "Spy for Moscow" Theory

PM Tusk stated that Jeffrey Epstein was **"likely a spy for Moscow"**:

- Intelligence-style operation

### Task Force

Poland is establishing an **analytical task force** to:
- Examine all Poland-related documents

**Body**: Lithuanian Prosecutors

### Prince Andrew

Following new documents, British authorities and media renewed calls for:
- Prince Andrew to **cooperate with investigations**

## Latvia

Latvia announced its investigation into the Epstein files the same day as Lithuania, signaling growing regional concern that Epstein's crimes crossed more borders than previously understood.

## Turkey

## Sweden

## Norway

### The Norwegian Political Storm

The Epstein files triggered a political earthquake in Norway, implicating **five prominent figures**. See [The Norway Scandal](The_Norway_Scandal.md) for comprehensive coverage.

| Figure | Role | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Crown Princess Mette-Marit** | Heir to throne | 100+ emails; stayed at Palm Beach home; "poor judgment" |
| **Thorbjørn Jagland** | Former PM; Nobel Committee Chair | Aggravated corruption probe by Okokrim |
| **Børge Brende** | Former FM; WEF CEO | WEF independent review launched |
| **Mona Juul** | Ambassador to Jordan/Iraq | Suspended from duties |
| **Terje Rød-Larsen** | Oslo Accords negotiator | Island visit with family; children in Epstein's will ($5M each) |

Norway's parliament Foreign Affairs Committee is conducting its own review, and a majority of parties support an independent inquiry into the foreign ministry.

## France

### Russian Disinformation Campaign

A large-scale **Russian disinformation operation** has used doctored French media reports to falsely link **President Emmanuel Macron** to Epstein's crimes:
- France's anti-disinformation agency **Viginum** identified the campaign
- A **fake article** on a website imitating French outlet **France Soir** was the catalyst
- False claims included that Macron attended "multiple parties" at Epstein's Paris residence

### Real (Limited) Connection
- **Tom Pritzker** referenced a meeting with Macron in emails to Epstein
- **Caroline Lang** (intermediary) emailed Epstein that *"Macron is going to announce a reshuffle of the government soon"*
- **No evidence** that Macron and Epstein ever met or communicated directly

### Inquiry Activity (Feb 16, 2026)

Reuters reported French investigators searched the **Arab World Institute** and properties linked to former culture minister **Jack Lang**, in connection with a broader inquiry tied to Epstein-related allegations.

- Prosecutors said the searches were part of an inquiry opened in 2021 after complaints.
- Reuters reported Lang denied any wrongdoing.
- This is distinct from the documented Russian disinformation operation targeting Macron.
