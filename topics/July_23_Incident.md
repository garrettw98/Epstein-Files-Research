# 🚑 The "First Attempt": July 23, 2019

> **Status**: **UNEXPLAINED INJURY**

Most people focus on August 10 (the death). But the events of July 23 are arguably more suspicious.

## The Incident
*   **Date**: July 23, 2019.
*   **The Scene**: Guards found Epstein semi-conscious in his cell with marks on his neck.
*   **Epstein's Claim**: He reportedly told his lawyers he had been **attacked**.

## The Cellmate: Nicholas Tartaglione
*   **Who is he?**: A former police officer turned quadruple murderer (accused of killing 4 men in a drug deal).
*   **The Question**: Why was a non-violent sex offender (Epstein) housed with a hulking quadruple murderer facing the death penalty?
*   **The Defense**: Tartaglione claimed he *saved* Epstein after seeing him try to hang himself.

## The "Missing" Video (Part 1)
*   **The Request**: Epstein's lawyers requested the surveillance footage from outside the cell for that night.
*   **The Response**: The jail prosecutors initially claimed they saved it.
*   **The Reality**: They later admitted they had **"accidentally saved the wrong footage"** (from a different tier of the jail).
*   **The Result**: The actual footage of the July 23 incident was **permanently lost/overwritten**.

## Significance
This incident is why Epstein was placed on "Suicide Watch." It is also the primary fuel for the theory that someone "got to him" in jail—first to warn him (July 23), then to finish the job (Aug 10).
