# ❓ Missing Evidence: What We Still Don't Know

> **Status**: **UNRELEASED / DISAPPEARED / REDACTED**

Despite millions of pages being released, key pieces of the puzzle remain missing.

## 1. The "Safe" Hard Drives
*   **The Item**: Hard drives and CDs found in the Manhattan safe.
*   **The Content**: The DOJ has confirmed they contain images, but they have never been described in detail or released.
*   **Significance**: This is the potential "Kompromat" (blackmail material).
*   **2026 Status**: Despite the massive "Transparency Act" release (3 million pages), these specific hard drives/images remain **unreleased** or were heavily redacted/withheld, fueling theories that they contain material too damaging to be made public.

## 2. The Island Surveillance
*   **The Item**: The hard drives from the server room on Little St. James.
*   **The Mystery**: While some footage was recovered, there has never been a public accounting of *who* is on those tapes.
*   **The "July 23" Tape**: The specific footage of Epstein's first suicide attempt "went missing" (was overwritten) due to a "clerical error."

## 3. The "1953 Trust" Beneficiaries
*   **The Item**: The trust document governing Epstein's $577 million estate.
*   **The Mystery**: We know *who runs it* (Indyke & Kahn), but we don't know *who gets the money* left over after victim compensation.
*   **Theory**: Is it being held for "future scientific research" (Eugenics)? Or secret associates?

## 4. The "Other" Little Black Book
*   **The Item**: A handheld scheduler from the 1990s.
*   **The Mystery**: The "Black Book" we have is from 2004-2005. A decade of contacts from the 1990s (the Wexner/Trump era) is largely missing from the public record.

## 5. The "Standard Hotel" Tapes (Los Angeles)
*   **The Item**: Epstein invested in the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood.
*   **The Rumor**: Victims have alleged abuse occurred there. Were there cameras?

## 6. The Zorro Ranch Server Scrub
*   **The Location**: The high-tech server room at the New Mexico ranch.
*   **The Incident**: Reports indicate the server room was **"professionally scrubbed"** (wiped clean) just days before the FBI raided the property in 2019.
*   **The Implication**: This suggests Epstein (or his associates) had advance warning of the raid or a "kill switch" protocol to destroy digital evidence.
