## 1. Hillary Clinton on the Plane
*   **The Rumor**: A photo of Hillary Clinton sitting on the lap of Jeffrey Epstein or on the plane.
*   **The Reality**: **False.** No such photo exists. While Bill Clinton is verified, Hillary has never been placed on the plane by logs or photos.

## 2. The "Trump Kissing a Girl"
*   **The Rumor**: Various blurry photos claiming to show Trump with a victim.
*   **The Reality**: Often misidentified photos of Trump with his own daughter (Ivanka) or other adult socialites. No verified photo of Trump with a trafficking victim exists.

## 3. The "Elon Musk" Island Photo
*   **The Rumor**: A photo of Musk walking with Ghislaine Maxwell on the island.
*   **The Reality**: **False.** The famous photo of Musk and Maxwell was taken at a *Vanity Fair* party in Los Angeles, not the island.

## Significance
Disinformation relies on "fake evidence." By cataloging what *isn't* real, we protect the integrity of what *is* real.
