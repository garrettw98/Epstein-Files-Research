# 🔬 The Science Club: Epstein and Academia

> **Status**: **DONATIONS / FUNDING** (Evidence Level: ◐ DOCUMENTED)

Jeffrey Epstein had a unique obsession with science, specifically "transhumanism," genetics, and physics. He aggressively courted the world's top scientific minds, often funding their research when traditional grants would not.

## The Strategy
Epstein used science as a "laundromat" for his reputation. By associating with Nobel Prize winners, he legitimized himself as a "science philanthropist" rather than just a finance guy.

## Key Figures
*   **[Bill Gates](../profiles/Bill_Gates.md)**: Met with Epstein to discuss global health funding. Epstein tried to leverage this to get involved with the Gates Foundation (unsuccessfully).
*   **[Reid Hoffman](../profiles/Reid_Hoffman.md)**: Visited the island with MIT scientists.
*   **Marvin Minsky (AI Pioneer)**: Accused by a victim of sexual assault on the island. (Minsky died in 2016).
*   **Stephen Hawking**: Visited the island for a conference. Epstein defended him against false rumors.
*   **Noam Chomsky**: Met with Epstein to discuss politics; Epstein facilitated a financial transfer for him.

## The "Eugenics" Ranch
*   **The Plan**: The 2026 release confirmed Epstein had bizarre plans for his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico. He told scientists he wanted to "seed the human race" with his own DNA by impregnating women at the ranch.
*   **The Reality**: While the *plan* was real (he discussed it with scientists), there is **no evidence** he ever successfully operationalized a breeding program.

## MIT Media Lab
*   **Joi Ito (Director)**: Resigned after it was revealed he accepted anonymous donations from Epstein (labeled as "Disqualified" in internal records) to fund the lab.
*   **The Cover-up**: Emails showed the lab actively tried to hide Epstein's involvement.
