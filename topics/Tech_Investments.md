# 📡 Tech Investments: Satellites & Surveillance

> **Status**: **FINANCIAL FACT / INTEL SPECULATION**

Epstein wasn't just investing in stocks. He put money into strategic, dual-use technologies that fueled the "Spy" rumors.

## 1. OneWeb (Satellite Internet)
*   **The Investment**: Epstein invested in **OneWeb**, a competitor to Starlink aimed at providing global satellite internet.
*   **The Intelligence Angle**: Satellite internet is a critical infrastructure for global surveillance and communication.
*   **The Question**: Why would a "money manager" interested in Victoria's Secret be investing in orbital infrastructure?

## 2. Carbyne (911 Technology)
*   **The Company**: An Israeli startup (formerly Reporty) that streams video/audio from 911 callers to dispatchers.
*   **The Capabilities (Surveillance Potential)**:
    *   **Camera Access**: The software allows dispatchers to access a caller's camera and microphone *without* them downloading an app (via a secure link).
    *   **Indoor Tracking**: It utilizes advanced "PinPoint" technology to locate callers indoors with <5 meter accuracy (far better than standard GPS).
    *   **The Risk**: While pitched as a life-saving tool, privacy advocates warn this creates a "backdoor" into any phone that dials 911, capturing video and audio that flows through servers potentially accessible by foreign intelligence (given the Barak/Epstein funding connection).
*   **The Founder**: Ehud Barak (former Israeli PM) was Chairman.
*   **The Funding**: Epstein provided the capital for Barak's investment.

## 3. The "Science" Laundromat
Epstein used his tech investments to get close to the "Edge Edge" (Edge.org), a group of elite thinkers.
*   **The Goal**: By funding "The Next Big Thing" (AI, Genetics, Space), he ensured he was always in the room where the future was being decided.

## 4. The Existential Risk Projects
Epstein's interests extended to the survival of the human race (or at least, *his* survival).
*   **Lifeboat Foundation**: Epstein sat on the **Advisory Board** of this non-profit dedicated to "safeguarding humanity" from existential risks (AI, Nanotech).
    *   *Significance*: This connected him to the "Doomsday Prepper" wing of Silicon Valley.
*   **The Vatican Bank Interest**: In 2013, Epstein emailed Larry Summers about the **Vatican Bank**, noting its status as a "sovereign" entity that could allow elite clients to evade financial scrutiny.
    *   *The Theory*: He was looking for a bank that was immune to US subpoenas.
