# 🏚️ The Aftermath: What Happened to the Money & The Island?

> **Status**: **SOLD / LIQUIDATED / SETTLED**

Jeffrey Epstein is dead, but his assets and the fallout continue to ripple through the world in 2026.

## 1. The Island Today (Little St. James)
*   **The Sale**: In May 2023, billionaire investor **Stephen Deckoff** bought both Little St. James and Great St. James for **$60 million**.
    *   *Note*: This was less than half the original asking price of $125 million.
*   **The Plan**: Deckoff announced plans to build a "world-class luxury resort" to open in 2025.
*   **The Reality (2026)**: The project is in limbo.
    *   *Conflicting Reports*: While some paparazzi photos from mid-2025 showed minor construction activity, local Virgin Islands officials stated in late 2025 that **no major permits had been filed** and the project appeared stalled.
    *   *The Ghost Town*: For now, the island sits largely abandoned, a ghost of the crimes committed there, with its future as a resort looking increasingly unlikely.

## 2. The Queen's Money (Prince Andrew's Settlement)
Prince Andrew settled with Virginia Giuffre for an estimated **£12 million ($16M)**. But he didn't have that kind of cash.
*   **The Contributor**: Reports confirmed that **Queen Elizabeth II** personally paid **£2 million ($2.7M)** towards the settlement.
*   **The Source**: The money came from the Duchy of Lancaster (her private estate), not taxpayer funds.
*   **Significance**: The British Monarch quietly financed the silence of a sex trafficking victim to protect the dignity of the Crown.

## 3. The "Standard Hotel" Incident (The Helicopter)
*   **The Location**: The Standard Hotel, High Line (New York) & West Hollywood.
*   **The Incident**: In 2002, a helicopter pilot attempted to land on the roof of the Standard Hotel in NYC (which has no helipad).
*   **The Passengers**: Reports allege the helicopter was carrying Jeffrey Epstein and a young girl.
*   **The Connection**: Epstein was an investor in the hotel chain (owned by Andre Balazs). This incident highlights his reckless behavior and the "rules don't apply to me" mentality.

## 4. The Estate Liquidation
*   **The Planes**: The "Lolita Express" (Boeing 727) and other aircraft were sold for scrap or to private buyers.
*   **The Houses**:
    *   **Palm Beach**: Demolished by a developer.
    *   **Manhattan**: Sold for ~$51 million (proceeds went to the Victims' Compensation Fund).
    *   **New Mexico (Zorro Ranch)**: Sold.
*   **The Victims' Fund**: The estate paid out over **$150 million** to roughly 135 victims before closing the compensation program.
