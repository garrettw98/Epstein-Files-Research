# The Art Market Money Channel

> **Status**: **FORENSIC HYPOTHESIS TRACK WITH DOCUMENTED LEADS**

## Summary

The art-market channel is a long-standing financial-forensics lead: high-value art can move wealth through opaque pricing, private transactions, and cross-border transfers. This repository tracks the channel as an investigative hypothesis with specific subpoena-era leads.

## Why It Matters

- Art transactions can obscure counterparties and effective value transfer.
- High-value movable assets can bridge jurisdictions and reporting gaps.

## Known Lead Structure in Repo

- Reported subpoenas/interest around major auction-market records.
- Questions around whether art holdings/transfers functioned as liquidity or concealment instruments.

## Evidence Posture

### Documented
- The channel appears in unresolved-lead documentation with concrete investigative targets.

### Unresolved
- Transaction-level chain proving laundering intent or beneficiary routing.
- Full linkage between specific art transactions and broader network payments.
