# 💰 The Institutional Enablers: The Banks

> **Summary**: Jeffrey Epstein did not act alone. Major global financial institutions knowingly facilitated his operations for profit, ignoring their own compliance teams.

## 🏦 JPMorgan Chase (The Primary Bank)
**Settlement: $290 Million (June 2023)**

*   **The Relationship**: Epstein was a client from 1998 to 2013.
*   **The Findings**:
    *   Epstein regularly withdrew massive amounts of cash (up to **$80,000 at a time**) to pay victims.
    *   Compliance officers flagged his accounts as "High Risk" for human trafficking repeatedly.
    *   **Jes Staley** (then a senior executive) protected Epstein, calling him a key client.
    *   The bank kept him as a client for **5 years after his 2008 sex crime conviction**.

## 🏦 Deutsche Bank (The Secondary Bank)
**Settlement: $75 Million (May 2023)**

*   **The Relationship**: Deutsche Bank accepted Epstein as a client in 2013 *after* JPMorgan finally dropped him.
*   **The Failures**:
    *   Processed millions in payments to Russian models and for "tuition" and "rent" for young women.
    *   Ignored the obvious reputational risk of banking a registered sex offender.
    *   Paid a separate **$150 million fine** to New York regulators in 2020.

## 🏦 Apollo Global Management (Leon Black)
*   **The Relationship**: Leon Black (CEO) paid Epstein **$158 million** between 2012 and 2017.
*   **The Explanation**: Black claimed this was for "tax and estate planning advice."
*   **The Outcome**: An independent review found no evidence Black was involved in Epstein's crimes, but the revelation of the payments forced him to resign as CEO.
