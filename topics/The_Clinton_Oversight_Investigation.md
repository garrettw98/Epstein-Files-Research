## Summary

In 2025-2026, the House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the Clintons' connections to Jeffrey Epstein, issuing subpoenas for testimony. After the Clintons refused to appear for scheduled depositions, the Committee voted to recommend contempt of Congress charges. The Clintons ultimately agreed to testify in late February 2026, averting a full House contempt vote.

## Timeline of Events

### July 23, 2025: Bipartisan Subpoena Vote

The Federal Law Enforcement Subcommittee voted **unanimously** (Republicans AND Democrats) to approve subpoenas for testimony from ten individuals, including:
- **Former President Bill Clinton**
- **Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton**

### August 5, 2025: Subpoenas Issued

Chairman Comer officially issued subpoenas to the Clintons.

**Initial Deposition Dates**:
- Bill Clinton: October 14, 2025 (later moved to December 17, 2025)
- Hillary Clinton: Separate date scheduled

### December 2025: First Missed Dates

The Clintons did not appear for their scheduled depositions:
- Legal team contested validity of subpoenas
- Called them **"invalid and legally unenforceable"**
- Claimed they were being **"unfairly singled out"**

### January 13, 2026: Bill Clinton No-Show

A follow-on subpoena set Bill Clinton's deposition for January 13, 2026.
- **He failed to appear**

### January 14, 2026: Hillary Clinton No-Show

Hillary Clinton was scheduled for January 14, 2026.
- **She failed to appear**

### January 21, 2026: Contempt Vote

The House Oversight Committee voted to recommend that the full House find **both Clintons in contempt of Congress** for defying subpoenas.

**Notable**: The vote included support from **nine Democrats** on the panel.

### February 3, 2026: Clintons Agree to Testify

After months of resistance, the Clintons agreed to appear for closed-door depositions:
- **Hillary Clinton**: February 26, 2026
- **Bill Clinton**: February 27, 2026

Chairman Comer announced: **"The Clintons caved."**

### Rules Committee Suspension

The Rules Committee had been scheduled to approve contempt resolutions for a full House vote. After the Clintons agreed to testify, the Committee **suspended consideration** of the resolutions.

## What the Documents Show

### Photos

The investigative file includes **never-before-seen photos** of Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein together, found in Epstein's New York home.

### Communications

Documents reveal **frequent communications between Ghislaine Maxwell and Clinton staffers** between 2001 and 2004.

### Flight Records

Previously documented: Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's plane **26+ times** (some counts higher).

### Public Inquiries

The FBI file contains messages from members of the public demanding to know why Clinton wasn't being investigated.

## Clinton Defenses

### Legal Arguments

The Clintons' attorneys argued:
- Subpoenas were **"invalid and legally unenforceable"**
- They were being **"unfairly singled out"**
- The investigation was politically motivated

### Prior Statements

Bill Clinton has previously stated:
- He had **no knowledge of wrongdoing** by Epstein
- **None of Epstein's victims have publicly accused Clinton** of involvement in crimes
- His flights were related to Clinton Foundation work

## Political Dynamics

### Democratic Division

The contempt proceedings exposed a **Democratic divide**:
- **Nine Democrats** on the Oversight panel supported contempt votes
- **Senior Democrats** opposed the move
- Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), co-author of the Transparency Act, criticized DOJ for releasing only "half the documents"

### Republican Strategy

After Clintons agreed to testify:
- Democrats warned they would seek testimony from **Donald Trump**
- Created potential for tit-for-tat subpoenas
- Raised questions about whether investigation would expand

### Bipartisan Origins

Notably, the **original subpoena vote was unanimous** (bipartisan), suggesting genuine interest in the investigation beyond partisan politics.

## What's at Stake

### For the Clintons

- **Sworn testimony** about Epstein relationship
- Potential for **perjury charges** if statements contradict evidence
- **Political damage** from detailed questioning
- **Historical record** of their involvement

### For the Investigation

- First major figures compelled to testify about Epstein
- May set precedent for additional witnesses
- Could reveal new information about Epstein's network
- Tests congressional oversight powers

## Outstanding Questions

1. **What will the Clintons be asked?** - Full scope of questioning unclear
2. **Will transcripts be released?** - Depositions are closed-door
3. **Other witnesses?** - Nine other individuals were subpoenaed
4. **Trump testimony?** - Democrats threaten reciprocal subpoenas
5. **Criminal referrals?** - Possible if perjury or other crimes discovered

## The Nine Democrats

The fact that **nine Democratic members** of the Oversight Committee supported contempt charges against the Clintons is significant:
- Breaks from typical party-line votes
- Suggests genuine bipartisan concern
- May reflect constituent pressure following document releases
