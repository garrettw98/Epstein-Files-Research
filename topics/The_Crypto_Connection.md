# ₿ The Crypto Connection: Bitcoin & "Zero Days"

> **Status**: **VERIFIED INVESTMENTS / THEORETICAL LAUNDERING**

Jeffrey Epstein wasn't just a fiat currency manipulator; he was an early adopter of cryptocurrency infrastructure.

## 1. The Investments
Epstein didn't just buy Bitcoin; he funded the *infrastructure* of the crypto world.
*   **Coinbase**: In 2014, Epstein invested **$3 million** in Coinbase's Series C round (via **Brock Pierce's** Blockchain Capital).
    *   *The Meeting*: Internal emails confirm Epstein met with Coinbase co-founder **Fred Ehrsam** to discuss the investment.
    *   *The Exit*: By 2018, Epstein was discussing selling his stake for ~$15 million.
*   **Blockstream**: He invested **$500,000** in Blockstream (a major Bitcoin infrastructure firm) in 2014 via a fund managed by **Joi Ito**.
*   **MIT Digital Currency Initiative (DCI)**: He donated **$525,000** to MIT specifically to fund the salaries of **Bitcoin Core developers** (including Wladimir van der Laan and Gavin Andresen) when the Bitcoin Foundation ran out of money.
    *   *Significance*: For a period in 2015, Jeffrey Epstein was effectively paying the salaries of the people maintaining the Bitcoin code.

## 2. The "Zero-Day" Plot (Bannon)
*   **The Discussion**: In 2018, Epstein and **Steve Bannon** discussed using "zero-day exploits" (unpatched software vulnerabilities) to target and drain cryptocurrency wallets.
*   **Significance**: This moves beyond "investment" into **cyber-warfare**. Why was a sex offender discussing military-grade hacking tools with a political strategist?

## 3. The "Whitewash" Theory
Analysts suggest Epstein saw Crypto as the ultimate money laundering tool.
*   **"Pay-to-Whiten"**: By funding the *developers* (MIT) and the *exchanges* (Coinbase), he sought to ingratiate himself with the libertarians building the new financial system, hoping they wouldn't care about his past.

## Verdict
Epstein wasn't a casual crypto bro. He was positioning himself as a foundational financier of the Bitcoin ecosystem, potentially to use it for off-the-books transfers or intelligence operations.
