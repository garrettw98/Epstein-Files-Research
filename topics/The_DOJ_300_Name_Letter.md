# The DOJ 300+ Name Letter (Feb 2026)

> **Status**: **DOCUMENTED LETTER CONTENT / INTERPRETATION DISPUTED**

## Summary

In February 2026, reporting by Reuters and CNN described a DOJ letter to lawmakers that listed more than 300 officials and politically exposed persons mentioned in Epstein-related records, while stating inclusion did not itself imply wrongdoing.

The core controversy is not only the list size. It is the absence of per-name contextual classification in the reported summary.

## Timeline

- **Feb 14, 2026**: DOJ letter date referenced in Reuters/CNN reporting.
- **Feb 15, 2026**: Reuters and CNN coverage made the letter content public in broad form.

## What the Reporting Said

- DOJ provided a list covering 300+ names in records.
- DOJ said mention in the summary does not itself establish misconduct.
- Per-name narrative context was not provided in the reported public summaries.

## Why It Matters

- A no-context list can be read as implicating people who may only be indirectly referenced.
- A no-context list can also obscure distinctions between direct contact evidence and incidental mentions.
- Researchers need a reproducible per-name classification standard before inference.

## What Is Documented vs Unresolved

### Documented
- Reuters and CNN reported the letter and its no-context caveat.
- DOJ's reported framing emphasized that mention does not equal wrongdoing.

### Unresolved
- Full unredacted text of the letter in this repository's primary-doc set.
- The exact inclusion criteria used for each listed name.
- Whether names came from direct records, media references, or third-party statements.

## Repository Guardrails

- Treat list inclusion as a **pointer**, not an adjudicative finding.
- Require record-level context before promoting claim severity.
- Keep direct evidence separate from administrative or indirect mentions.
