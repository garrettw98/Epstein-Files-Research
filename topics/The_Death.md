# 💀 The Death of Jeffrey Epstein

> **Official Ruling**: **SUICIDE BY HANGING**
> **Public Status**: **HIGHLY SKEPTICAL**

On August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. While officially ruled a suicide, the circumstances have fueled endless theories.

## The Official Narrative
*   **Time**: Approx 6:30 AM.
*   **Method**: Hanged himself with a bedsheet.
*   **Medical Examiner**: Dr. Barbara Sampson ruled it a suicide.

## The Suspicious Circumstances (Verified Facts)
1.  **Suicide Watch Removed**: Epstein had attempted suicide (or was assaulted) on July 23. He was placed on suicide watch but **removed just 6 days later**.
2.  **No Cellmate**: His cellmate was transferred out the night before his death, leaving him alone.
3.  **Sleeping Guards**: The two guards assigned to check on him every 30 minutes **fell asleep** and falsified log records to make it look like they had checked.
4.  **Broken Cameras**: Two cameras outside his cell malfunctioned or had "unusable" footage for that specific timeframe.

## The 2026 "Suicide Note" Discovery
In the Jan 2026 release, a file was found containing a handwritten note by an investigator (dating from 2019). It read:
> *"The note found near the body does not appear to be a suicide note."*
This contradicts the initial reports that implied he left a final message.

## The "Homicide" Theory
**Dr. Michael Baden**, a famous pathologist hired by Epstein's brother, observed the autopsy.
*   **Hyoid Bone**: He noted three fractures in the neck bones, including the **hyoid bone**.
*   **Significance**: While hyoid breaks *can* happen in hangings (especially in older men), they are **more common in strangulation homicide**.
*   **Conclusion**: Baden stated the evidence points "more to homicide than suicide."

## Verdict
**Officially Suicide.** However, the catastrophic failures of the prison system (sleeping guards, broken cameras, removed cellmate) created a perfect storm for conspiracy theories that may never be fully debunked.
