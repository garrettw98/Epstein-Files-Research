# 🛡️ The Defense Playbook: How They Tried to Win

> **Status**: **LEGAL STRATEGY ANALYSIS**

Epstein's lawyers (and later Maxwell's) didn't argue that the events didn't happen. They argued that they weren't crimes.

## 1. The "Consent" Defense
*   **The Argument**: Many victims were 16 or 17. In New York, the age of consent is 17.
*   **The Pivot**: They tried to frame the encounters as consensual relationships between an older man and younger women, ignoring the "Trafficking" (payment/coercion) aspect which makes age irrelevant.

## 2. The "Gold Digger" Defense
*   **The Strategy**: Attack the victims' credibility by focusing on the money.
*   **The Claim**: "They are only suing now because he is rich."
*   **The Reality**: Many victims came forward *before* there was any money on the table (2005/2006).

## 3. The "Memory" Defense (Elizabeth Loftus)
*   **The Expert**: Ghislaine Maxwell's team hired **Elizabeth Loftus**, a famous memory expert.
*   **The Theory**: "False Memory Syndrome." They argued that victims' memories were "contaminated" by media coverage and time.
*   **The Outcome**: The jury rejected this, finding the corroborating evidence (flight logs, payouts) too strong.

## 4. The "Epstein is Dead" Defense
*   **The Pivot**: In Maxwell's trial, her lawyers argued she was being punished for Epstein's crimes because he was dead. "She is not a proxy for Jeffrey Epstein."
*   **The Result**: Failed. The jury found her guilty of *her own* actions (recruitment).
