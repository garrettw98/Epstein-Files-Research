# The Draft Indictment (Florida, ~2007)

> **Status**: **RELEASED** (January 30, 2026 DOJ Release)
> **Document**: 56-page draft federal indictment, Southern District of Florida
> **Defendants**: Jeffrey Epstein + 3 unnamed co-conspirators (redacted)
> **Victims**: 19 Jane Does (ages 14-17)

## Summary

Among the most significant documents in the January 2026 release was a **56-page draft federal indictment** prepared by prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida in the mid-2000s. The indictment would have charged Epstein and **three unnamed co-conspirators** with dozens of counts of sex trafficking, conspiracy, enticement of minors, and related crimes. It was never filed — instead, prosecutors reached the infamous **Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA)** in 2007.

## The Charges

The draft indictment contained **32 counts**, including:

1. **Conspiracy** to procure females under age 18 for lewd conduct (2001-2005)
2. **Sex trafficking of minors**
3. **Enticement of a minor**
4. **Travel to engage in illicit sexual conduct**
5. **Facilitation of unlawful travel**

### The 19 Victims

The indictment identified **19 different victims**, labeled Jane Doe #1 through #19:
- The youngest was described as **14 years old**
- Many were ages **16 or 17**
- The abuse spanned **2001 to 2005**

### The Three Co-Conspirators

Three individuals were named alongside Epstein as defendants:
- All three are described as Epstein's **"assistants"**
- Their roles included: scheduling appointments, making phone calls, paying victims
- Their names are **fully redacted** in the released version
- They are female (DOJ confirmed: "We did not redact any names of men, only female victims")

The DOJ explained: *"In many instances, as it has been well documented publicly, those who were originally victims became participants and co-conspirators."*

## Why It Was Never Filed

Instead of bringing the 32-count indictment, federal prosecutors in 2007 reached the **Non-Prosecution Agreement** with Epstein:
- Epstein pleaded guilty to **state prostitution charges** only
- Served **13 months** in county jail with work release
- **All named and unnamed co-conspirators** received immunity
- Victims were not notified of the deal (later ruled a violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act)

In a 2020 review, the Justice Department found that former US Attorney **Alexander Acosta** had used **"poor judgment"** but did not find professional misconduct.

## The Prosecution Memorandum

Alongside the draft indictment, prosecutors also prepared an **82-page prosecution memorandum** laying out the evidence. Representatives **Ro Khanna** and **Thomas Massie** have demanded to see the unredacted versions of both documents, arguing they are *"essential to understanding the government's knowledge of Epstein's criminal conduct."*

## The Redaction Controversy

The handling of this document exemplified the broader criticism of the DOJ's release:

### Perpetrators Hidden, Victims Exposed

CNN investigation found that the DOJ:
- **Redacted the names of all co-conspirators** (potential perpetrators)
- **Exposed the names of 43+ victims** through redaction failures elsewhere in the release

Attorney **Jennifer Freeman** called the redactions **"ham-fisted"** and accused the DOJ of *"hiding the names of perpetrators while exposing survivors."*

Attorney **Sigrid McCawley** added that the approach was *"backwards"* — protecting the accused while endangering victims.

### DOJ Defense

A DOJ official stated:
> *"Any fully redacted names are of victims. We did not redact any names of men, only female victims."*

This explanation was criticized as circular, since many victims were also co-conspirators.

## Significance

The draft indictment is significant because it proves:

1. **Federal prosecutors had enough evidence** for a multi-count indictment
2. **Three co-conspirators** were identified and could have been charged
3. **19 victims** were documented as early as the mid-2000s
4. The NPA was a **deliberate decision** to forgo prosecution, not a lack of evidence
5. The redaction of co-conspirators' names in 2026 means **accountability was blocked twice** — once in 2007 and again in 2026

## The FBI Co-Conspirators List (2019)

A separate internal FBI document created in **August 2019** — five days after Epstein's death — lists **eight persons** as "suspected co-conspirators":
- **Ghislaine Maxwell** (identified by name)
- **Jean-Luc Brunel** (identified by name)
- Six others with names and faces **redacted**
- **Two** of those designated as co-conspirators were also identified as victims
- **Les Wexner** was included on a separate list of Epstein's "10 co-conspirators" in an FBI email
