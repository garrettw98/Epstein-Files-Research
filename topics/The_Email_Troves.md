# 📧 The Email Troves: What the "Private" Inbox Revealed

> **Status**: **VERIFIED CORRESPONDENCE** (2023-2024 Releases)

While the "Black Book" showed who Epstein *knew*, the leaked emails show *how he operated*. These communications, released in the *USVI v. JPMorgan* lawsuit, reveal the daily mechanics of his influence peddling.

## 1. Noam Chomsky (The $270k Question)
*   **The Relationship**: The world-famous linguist met with Epstein multiple times between 2015 and 2016 (long after Epstein's conviction).
*   **The Money**: Records show a wire transfer of **$270,000** from an Epstein-linked account to Chomsky.
    *   *The Explanation*: Chomsky claims this was a technicality involving the transfer of his late wife's estate funds, and Epstein just "facilitated" it.
    *   *The "Why"*: Why would a famous anti-capitalist intellectual use a sex offender money manager for a simple estate transfer?
*   **The Dinner**: Chomsky flew on Epstein's jet to have dinner with **Woody Allen** and **Soon-Yi Previn**.
*   **The Quote**: When asked about the association, Chomsky famously replied: *"It's none of your business."*

## 2. Bard College & Leon Botstein
*   **The Scheme**: **Leon Botstein**, President of Bard College, met Epstein dozens of times to secure funding.
*   **The "Laundering" Payment**: Epstein gave Botstein **$150,000 personally** (labeled as "consulting fees").
    *   *The Twist*: Botstein then donated that same amount to the college.
    *   *Significance*: This structure avoided direct "Epstein -> College" donations that might trigger compliance red flags.
*   **The Laptops**: Epstein also donated 66 laptops to the college (unsolicited).

## 3. Woody Allen (The "Castle Dracula" Regular)
*   **The Regular**: Woody Allen was a staple at Epstein's "Salon" dinners from 2010 to 2019.
*   **The Letter**: Allen wrote a birthday note to Epstein comparing his townhouse to "Castle Dracula" but praising the "interesting people" he met there (Prince Andrew, Bill Gates).
*   **The Art**: Epstein would screen Allen's new movies for guests at the mansion.

## 4. Thorbjørn Jagland (The Nobel Connection)
*   **Who is he?**: Former Prime Minister of Norway and Chair of the **Nobel Peace Prize** committee.
*   **The "Trump/Russia" Angle**: Emails show Epstein positioning himself as a backchannel to the Trump administration for foreign diplomats.
    *   *The Offer*: Epstein suggested Jagland arrange a meeting with **Sergey Lavrov** (Russian Foreign Minister) so Epstein could explain "how to talk to Trump."
*   **The Island Quote**: In one email, Jagland joked: *"If Trump wins... I'll settle on your island."*
*   **The Fallout**: Jagland was later demoted from his Nobel position, a move widely linked to his judgment in associations.

## 5. Ehud Barak (The Daily Schedule)
*   **The Frequency**: Emails show Barak and Epstein met **monthly** for nearly a year.
*   **The Topics**: They discussed investments in Israeli drone tech and surveillance companies (Carbyne).
*   **The Itinerary**: Barak's wife sent itineraries for trips to **St. Thomas** (the gateway to Little St. James).

## 6. Jes Staley (The Disney Code)
*   **The Email**: In July 2010, Staley wrote to Epstein: *"That was fun. Say hi to Snow White."*
*   **The Reply**: Epstein responded: *"What character would you like next?"* Staley replied: *"Beauty and the Beast."*
*   **Significance**: This exchange is cited in the USVI lawsuit as proof that "Disney Princesses" was a code for specific young women procured for Staley.

## 7. Peter Attia (The "Locker Room" Talk)
*   **Volume**: 1,700 mentions in the files.
*   **The Content**: "Crude, tasteless banter" about women (responding to "fresh shipment" photos).
*   **The Admission**: Attia wrote about having "JE withdrawal" when he didn't see Epstein.

## 7. Terje Rød-Larsen (The Diplomat's Loan)
*   **The Loan**: Emails confirm a **$130,000 personal loan** from Epstein to the Norwegian diplomat.
*   **The Will**: A bizarre revelation that Epstein listed Rød-Larsen's children as potential beneficiaries ($5M each).
*   **The Slur**: Emails show Rød-Larsen using racist language ("kill the Indian first") in casual conversation with Epstein.

## 8. George Mitchell (The Post-Conviction Meetings)
*   **The Emails**: Communications from 2010-2013 show Epstein trying to set up meetings with the former Senate Majority Leader.
*   **The Date**: A specific calendar entry exists for **Nov 6, 2013** (10:30 AM).
*   **Significance**: This proves Epstein was still actively networking with top US political figures five years after his sex offender conviction.

## Significance
These emails prove that Epstein's "exile" after 2008 was a myth. He wasn't a pariah; he was a hub. He was managing money for socialists (Chomsky), advising diplomats (Jagland/Larsen), and funding colleges (Bard) right up until the end.
