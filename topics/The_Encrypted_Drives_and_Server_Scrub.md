# The Encrypted Drives and Server Scrub

> **Status**: **OPEN FORENSIC QUESTION SET**

## Summary

Repository materials repeatedly reference encrypted/scrubbed digital assets and unresolved questions about what was accessible in public disclosures. This topic consolidates those references into a forensic-question framework.

## Key Questions

1. Which seized digital devices remained unreadable due to encryption status?
2. Which systems were reportedly wiped, overwritten, or partially unavailable?
3. What parts of digital evidence were described in inventories but absent in public production?
4. What chain-of-custody and forensic logs are publicly accessible?

## Why It Matters

- Digital evidence is central to corroboration of communication, logistics, and surveillance claims.
- Gaps in publicly available forensic outcomes can sustain unresolved dispute cycles.

## Evidence Posture

### Documented
- Seizure of digital media and recurring references to unavailable or missing digital material.

### Unresolved
- Publicly complete decryption/outcome matrix by device.
- Full forensic reconciliation across seized, processed, and released artifacts.
