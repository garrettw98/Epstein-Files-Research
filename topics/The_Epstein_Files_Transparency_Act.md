## Criticisms

### Incomplete Disclosure

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), **co-author of the law**, stated:
> The Justice Department has "released at best half the documents" required under the law.

### "Two Eiffel Towers"

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche described the volume:
> "Think about this: you're talking about pieces of paper that stack from the ground to two Eiffel Towers."

This was offered as explanation for difficulties in proper redaction.

### Reasons for Withholding

DOJ stated documents were withheld due to:
- **Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)**
- **Victim privacy protections**
- **Ongoing investigations**
- **National security concerns**

### Victim Advocates' Response

Advocates argue:
- Too many documents still hidden
- Powerful people being protected
- Full transparency not achieved

## The Redaction Scandal

### Failures

The release was marred by serious redaction failures:
- **43+ victims' names exposed** (Wall Street Journal count)
- Including **24+ minors**
- Some names appeared **100+ times**
- Home addresses visible
- **Nude images** published with faces visible

### "Soft Redactions"

Initial releases contained "soft" redactions:
- Black boxes over text
- Could be copied/pasted to reveal hidden content
- Millions downloaded unredacted versions before fix

### Emergency Motion

On February 1, 2026, attorneys representing **200+ victims** asked federal judges to **immediately shut down** the DOJ website, calling it:
> "The single most egregious violation of victim privacy in one day in United States history."

## Political Implications

### Bipartisan Support

The near-unanimous passage (427-1 House, unanimous Senate) reflects:
- Rare bipartisan agreement
- Public pressure for transparency
- Distrust of DOJ's prior handling

### Administration Tensions

Despite Trump signing the law:
- His name appears thousands of times in files
- Cabinet members (Lutnick) implicated
- Deputy AG defending incomplete release

### Public Opinion

A **January 2026 CNN poll** found:
- Only **6%** of Americans said they were satisfied with what the federal government had released
- **49%** were dissatisfied
- Nearly half of **Republicans**, three-quarters of **independents**, and 9 in 10 **Democrats** said the government was withholding information
- A December 2025 **Reuters poll** found only **23%** of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the Epstein case

### Ongoing Scrutiny

Both parties have criticized DOJ's handling:
- **Republicans**: Want more disclosure
- **Democrats**: Concerned about selective protection of Trump allies
- **Victim advocates**: Want better victim protection AND full disclosure of perpetrators

## What Remains Hidden

### Known Withheld Categories

1. **CSAM** - Child sexual abuse material
2. **Grand Jury Materials** - Some legally protected
3. **National Security** - Intelligence-related documents
4. **Ongoing Investigations** - Though DOJ says none active

### Suspected Withheld Content

Critics allege additional documents withheld relating to:
- Certain political figures
- Intelligence agency connections
- Foreign government involvement

## The Congressional Unredaction Battle (February 9-10, 2026)

### Congressional Access to Unredacted Files

On **February 9, 2026**, the DOJ created a secure reading room where members of Congress could view the **original, unredacted files** with 24 hours' notice.

### Massie & Khanna's Review

The two **co-authors of the Act** were among the first to review files. After approximately two hours, they discovered **six men** whose names were redacted in the public release but visible in the unredacted versions. They described these individuals as "likely incriminated" by their inclusion.

### Live Television Confrontation

Massie appeared on **CNN** with Kaitlan Collins and publicly challenged Deputy AG **Todd Blanche** over specific redactions. The exchange led to the DOJ **unredacting 16 of 18 hidden names** from a 20-person list in real time, including three individuals designated as FBI **co-conspirators**: Les Wexner, Lesley Groff, and Jean-Luc Brunel.

### House Floor Disclosure

On **February 10**, Khanna named all six individuals on the **House floor** under the **Speech or Debate Clause**: Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov, Nicola Caputo, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, and Leslie Wexner.

### FBI Scrubbing Allegation

Khanna accused the **FBI** of **scrubbing files in March** 2025 — months before the Act was signed — removing survivors' statements naming powerful men. The DOJ told the lawmakers they "just uploaded whatever the FBI sent us."

### Massie's "Nuclear Option"

Massie threatened to **read Epstein's client names** on the House floor if AG Bondi's DOJ refused to comply with the Act's transparency requirements.

### AG Bondi Testimony (Held Feb 11)

AG **Pam Bondi** testified before the **House Judiciary Committee** on **February 11, 2026**. During more than five hours of testimony, she was pressed by members of both parties over redactions, release sequencing, and DOJ process decisions tied to the Transparency Act.

### Remaining Issues

Khanna stated **"70 to 80 percent of the files are still redacted"** even in the supposedly unredacted versions shown to Congress, and asked: "If we found six men that they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those 3 million files."
