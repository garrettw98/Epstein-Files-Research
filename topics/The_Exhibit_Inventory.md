# 🗃️ The Exhibit Inventory: Physical Evidence Seized (2019)

> **Status**: **VERIFIED FBI EVIDENCE LIST**

When the FBI raided 9 East 71st Street on July 6, 2019, they didn't just find a messy house; they found a "Go-Bag" life. This is the inventory of key items entered into evidence.

## 1. The Safe
*   **Passports**:
    *   One Austrian passport (Fake name: "Marius Fortelni") with Saudi residence.
    *   Multiple US passports with various entry stamps.
*   **Diamonds**: 48 loose diamonds (various cuts/sizes).
*   **Cash**: ~$70,000 in US currency (bundled).

## 2. The Media
*   **The "Massaging" CD**: A disc with a handwritten label containing a victim's name + "Massaging."
*   **Hard Drives**: Multiple loose hard drives found in the media room.
*   **Photos**: Thousands of loose photographs of young women (some nude) found in envelopes.

## 3. The "Massage" Rooms
*   **The Tools**: Massage tables, oils, and towels.
*   **The Toys**: Vibrators and other sex toys found in bedside drawers.
*   **The Decor**: The "Blue Dress" painting and the "Eye" hallway.

## 4. The Computers
*   **The Server**: A high-end server rack (likely for the surveillance system).
*   **The Cables**: Loose AV cables indicating cameras had been recently disconnected or moved.

## Significance
This physical evidence destroyed Epstein's defense that he was just a "socialite." The fake passport proved flight risk; the CDs proved he kept "trophies"; the diamonds proved he was ready to run.
