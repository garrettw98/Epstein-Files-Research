# The FBI "Prominent Names" Presentation

> **Status**: **DOCUMENTED ARTIFACT REFERENCE / VERIFICATION GAP**

## Summary

Repository release summaries describe a 21-slide FBI presentation created after mid-July 2025 that compiled "prominent names" from Epstein-related investigative files and requested collection of "salacious statements" about selected individuals.

The existence of the presentation matters because it indicates a structured internal categorization effort during the broader disclosure period.

## Key Points Reported in This Repo

- The deck reportedly listed high-profile names.
- It reportedly requested compilation of statements about those names.
- Public summaries indicate allegations in the deck were not uniformly verified in disclosed context.

## Why This Matters

- Distinguishes investigative cataloging from prosecutorial findings.
- Raises process questions about purpose: disclosure prep, risk management, or investigative triage.
- Requires careful handling to avoid converting unverified statements into implied facts.

## What Is Documented vs Unresolved

### Documented
- The deck is referenced in release-phase reporting summaries in repository evidence files.

### Unresolved
- Full primary copy provenance in `derived/primary_docs/` with stable artifact ID.
- Verification workflow used for statements included in the deck.
- How, if at all, deck entries informed redaction decisions.

## Research Rules

- Treat deck references as **process evidence**, not guilt evidence.
- Require independent primary corroboration for any person-level claim.
- Preserve attribution chains for every assertion derived from the deck.
