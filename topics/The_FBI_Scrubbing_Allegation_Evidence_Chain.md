# The FBI Scrubbing Allegation Evidence Chain

> **Status**: **CREDIBLE ALLEGATION / NOT FULLY PROVEN IN PUBLIC RECORD**

## Summary

In February 2026, lawmakers alleged that FBI file content had been scrubbed or altered before DOJ publication. This file tracks the allegation as an evidence-chain problem rather than a settled conclusion.

## Allegation Snapshot

- Public allegation: records were scrubbed before final release.
- Counter-position: DOJ process statements framed publication as based on files received from FBI inputs.

## Evidence Chain Required for Confirmation

To move from allegation to documented finding, the repository would need:

1. Pre-release source snapshots (hash-stable baseline).
2. Post-release snapshots (same document IDs).
3. Redaction-change logs or revision metadata.
4. Custody chain showing where edits occurred.
5. Independent corroboration (court filing, sworn testimony, or official audit document).

## Current Repository State

### Documented
- Allegation is attributed and repeatedly recorded in release-period files.
- Redaction disputes and process conflicts are independently documented.

### Missing for Proof
- Complete before/after artifact chain in primary-doc records.
- Authoritative forensic record attributing deletions to a specific unit and date.

## Research Handling Rule

- Label as **allegation** unless and until a primary evidence chain closes attribution.
- Avoid implying motive in claim text without direct documentary support.
