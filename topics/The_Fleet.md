# ✈️ The Fleet: The "Lolita Express" & Logistics

> **Status**: **VERIFIED ASSETS / CRIME SCENES**

Epstein's operation was global. To move victims, money, and powerful friends between New York, Paris, New Mexico, and the Virgin Islands, he maintained a private air force.

## 1. The Boeing 727 ("The Lolita Express")
*   **Tail Number**: **N908JE**
*   **The Plane**: A large commercial airliner converted for private use.
*   **Significance**: This is the plane found in the Flight Logs. It ferried Clinton, Trump, Prince Andrew, and Spacey.
*   **The Interior**: Victims described a custom interior with a bed and thick shag carpet. It was a primary location for abuse during transit.
*   **Fate**: Sold and reportedly scrapped.

## 2. The Gulfstream IV
*   **Tail Number**: **N120JE**
*   **The Plane**: A smaller, faster luxury jet.
*   **Use**: Often used for domestic flights or when the 727 was too conspicuous.
*   **The "JE"**: Epstein's vanity tail numbers (JE = Jeffrey Epstein) made his movements easy to track for those paying attention.

## 3. The Bell 430 Helicopter
*   **Use**: The "last mile" transport.
*   **Route**: It ferried guests from St. Thomas (commercial airport) to the helipad on Little St. James.
*   **Incidents**: This (or a similar chopper) was involved in the "Standard Hotel" landing attempt in NYC.

## 4. The Pilots
*   **David Rodgers & Larry Visoski**: They flew for Epstein for decades.
*   **The Logs**: They kept the records that eventually exposed the entire network.
*   **Testimony**: They testified they kept the cockpit door locked and "saw nothing," but their logs prove *who* was there.

## Why It Matters
Trafficking requires transportation. Epstein's fleet allowed him to bypass commercial security, customs scrutiny (often), and privacy, moving victims across state and international lines with impunity.
