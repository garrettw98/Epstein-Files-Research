# 🇫🇷 The French Connection: Paris & Brunel

> **Status**: **PARALLEL INVESTIGATION**

Epstein wasn't just an American problem. He spent significant time in Paris, and his "scout," Jean-Luc Brunel, was French.

## The Apartment: 22 Avenue Foch
*   **Location**: One of the most prestigious streets in Paris, near the Arc de Triomphe.
*   **The Design**: Visitors described it as bizarre, with a massage room and photos of Epstein with celebrities.
*   **The "Last Stop"**: Epstein was flying back from this apartment when he was arrested in New Jersey in 2019.

## The French Investigation
After Epstein's arrest in the US, French prosecutors opened their own probe.
*   **The Target**: **Jean-Luc Brunel** (MC2 Models).
*   **The Findings**: Police raided the Karin Models offices.
*   **The Arrest**: Brunel was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport attempting to flee to Senegal.

## Why It Matters
*   **The "Pipeline"**: France was the hub for the European leg of the trafficking operation. Brunel used his status in the Paris fashion world to legitimize the recruitment of young Eastern European girls.
*   **The Sovereign Barrier**: Epstein likely felt safe in Paris because France typically does not extradite its citizens (though Epstein was American).

## The End of the Line
With Brunel's death in a Paris prison (2022), the French criminal case was largely closed, leaving many European victims without their day in court.

## 2026 Reopen Signals
Reuters reported that on **February 16, 2026**, French investigators searched the **Arab World Institute** and properties linked to former culture minister **Jack Lang** as part of an inquiry tied to Epstein-related allegations opened in 2021.

- Lang denied wrongdoing in Reuters reporting.
- This appears to be a separate investigative track from the Macron disinformation campaign described in [International Investigations](International_Investigations.md).
