# 🇮🇱 The Israel Connection: Ideology & The "Mega Group"

> **Status**: **DOCUMENTED FINANCIAL & SOCIAL TIES**
> **Public Consensus**: **HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL**

While the "Mossad Spy" theory focuses on intelligence work, there is a separate layer of connections involving **ideology**, **philanthropy**, and the **"Mega Group"** of pro-Israel billionaires.

## 1. The "Mega Group"
*   **What it was**: An informal club formed in 1991 by **Les Wexner** (Epstein's patron) and **Charles Bronfman**.
*   **The Members**: Included some of the world's wealthiest Jewish philanthropists (Steven Spielberg, Ronald Lauder, Michael Steinhardt).
*   **The Goal**: To discuss "Jewish continuity," philanthropy, and support for Israel.
*   **Epstein's Role**: While not a formal member, Epstein was Les Wexner's "right hand." He attended meetings and, according to victim **Maria Farmer**, acted as an enforcer or fixer for this elite circle.

## 2. Maria Farmer's Testimony ("Supremacy" Allegations)
Maria Farmer, the first whistleblower (1996), has been the most vocal about the ideological aspect of the operation.
*   **The "Supremacy" Quote**: In interviews, Farmer has stated that Epstein and Maxwell operated what she called a "Jewish supremacist" ring.
    *   *Context*: She claimed they viewed themselves as "above the law" and "above" the non-Jewish victims they recruited (often referring to them as "goyim" in a derogatory manner, though this specific language is contested).
*   **The "Protectors"**: Farmer alleged that whenever she tried to report them, she was shut down by powerful people who protected the "Mega Group" interests.

## 3. The Wexner Foundation & Israel
Epstein had Power of Attorney over Les Wexner's finances, meaning he effectively controlled the **Wexner Foundation**.
*   **The Funding**: Under Epstein's tenure, the foundation poured millions into pro-Israel causes:
    *   **Birthright Israel**: Free trips for young Jewish adults.
    *   **The Wexner Israel Fellowship**: A program that brings Israeli public officials (including military and intelligence officers) to Harvard for a master's degree.
    *   **Significance**: Through this program, Epstein rubbed shoulders with the future leaders of the Israeli defense establishment.

## 4. Yoni Koren (The Handler?)
*   **Who is he?**: A former Chief of Staff to the Israeli Minister of Defense and a senior intelligence figure.
*   **The Connection**: Leaked documents (and visitor logs) show Koren visited Epstein's Manhattan townhouse **multiple times** between 2013 and 2016 (post-conviction).
*   **The Implication**: Critics argue a senior Israeli defense official would not visit a registered sex offender repeatedly unless there was a strategic (intelligence) reason.

## 5. Ehud Barak's "Research"
*   **The Grant**: In 2004, the Wexner Foundation (controlled by Epstein) paid **Ehud Barak** (former Israeli PM) **$2.3 million** for "research."
*   **The Mystery**: The specific nature of this research was never fully explained, leading to accusations that it was a payout or a way to funnel money for other services.

## Verdict
**Verified Ties.** Epstein was deeply embedded in the highest levels of pro-Israel philanthropy and the Israeli defense establishment via Les Wexner and the Mega Group. Whether this was motivated by genuine Zionist ideology or simply a cover for intelligence gathering remains the core debate.
