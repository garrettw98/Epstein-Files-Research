# The LA28/Wasserman Fallout

> **Status**: **RELEASE-PHASE FALLOUT TRACKER**

## Summary

This topic tracks the 2026 fallout around LA28 organizing chair Casey Wasserman after reporting on Maxwell-linked emails and subsequent political pressure related to Olympic governance.

## Timeline

- **Feb 14, 2026**: AP reported Wasserman would sell his talent agency after email-related disclosures.
- **Feb 18, 2026 (reported)**: Additional reporting said local officials called for him to step down as LA28 chair.

## Why This Matters

- LA28 is a major global event organization; leadership controversy carries public-governance and reputational implications.
- The case is a model for how file-release disclosures affect institutions not directly part of criminal proceedings.

## Evidence Status

- Current repository basis is primarily **verified secondary** reporting.
- Primary-record chain for underlying email artifacts should be added before any stronger factual inference.

## Research Guardrails

- Treat this as governance fallout, not adjudication.
- Separate:
  - event reporting,
  - organizational action,
  - legal determination.
