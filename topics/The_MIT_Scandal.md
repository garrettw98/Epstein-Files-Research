# 🎓 The MIT Media Lab Scandal

> **Status**: **VERIFIED COVER-UP** (Resignations & Reports)

It wasn't just "Science" in general; it was specifically the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)** that enabled Epstein's reputation laundering.

## The Players
*   **Joi Ito**: The Director of the famous MIT Media Lab.
*   **Marvin Minsky**: The "Father of Artificial Intelligence" and MIT professor.
*   **Signe Swenson**: The whistleblower (Development Associate).

## The Cover-Up
*   **The Donations**: Epstein donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Media Lab.
*   **"Disqualified"**: Because Epstein was a convicted sex offender, he was listed as "Disqualified" in MIT's donor database.
*   **The Workaround**: Joi Ito and his staff created a system to accept the money anyway, marking it as "Anonymous" to hide the source.
*   **The Gates Connection**: Emails show Ito referring to money as coming from "Gates/Epstein" (though Bill Gates denies this specific pooling).

## The Accusation Against Minsky
*   **The Island**: Virginia Giuffre testified that she was directed to have sex with Marvin Minsky on Epstein's island.
*   **The Defense**: Minsky died in 2016 and could not defend himself. His widow has denied the claims.

## The Whistleblower
**Signe Swenson** worked in the development office.
*   **The Report**: She flagged the donations and Epstein's visits to the lab.
*   **The Silence**: She testified that she was told to keep quiet because "he gives us money." She eventually resigned in protest.

## The Fallout
*   **Resignation**: After Ronan Farrow (New Yorker) exposed the cover-up in 2019, Joi Ito resigned.
*   **Report**: An internal MIT report confirmed the failures but largely absolved the university president, sparking further outrage.
