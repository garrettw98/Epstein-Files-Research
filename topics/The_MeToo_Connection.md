# The #MeToo Connection

> **Status**: **DOCUMENTED** (2026 Release)
> **Period**: 2017-2019
> **Key Finding**: Epstein monitored #MeToo accusations and quietly advised accused men

## Summary

The 2026 Epstein files revealed that Epstein closely tracked the #MeToo movement's fallout and positioned himself as a behind-the-scenes adviser to accused men, leveraging attorney **Kathryn Ruemmler** (former Obama White House Counsel) as his go-to crisis lawyer.

## Epstein's #MeToo Monitoring

Epstein was closely following accusations against:
- **Harvey Weinstein** (producer; convicted of rape)
- **Brett Ratner** (director; accused by 6 women)
- **Charlie Rose** (TV host; fired from CBS/PBS)
- **Louis C.K.** (comedian; admitted to misconduct)
- **Matt Lauer** (Today Show host; fired from NBC)
- **Les Moonves** (CBS chairman; resigned)
- **Richard Meier** (architect; accused by employees)

## Key Emails

### October 6, 2017: Weinstein Breaking
Epstein emailed **Brad Karp** (Paul Weiss chairman):
> "How bad does the harvey weinstein story get?"

Karp replied:
> "I think it gets pretty bad — and a little bit worse every day."

### October 10, 2017: Ruemmler Exchange
Epstein emailed **Kathryn Ruemmler** about Weinstein. She replied:
> "Whoever was not harassed by Harvey Weinstein must feel offended! Jesus!"

Epstein responded:
> "No worry, that means only grandmothers. Wait, its not all out yet."

### November 21, 2017: "Looking Better and Better"
Epstein emailed **Peggy Siegal**:
> "charlie, harvey, brett. louis. . jeffrey is looking better and better."

Siegal replied:
> "You suffered for a few years and now you are the least of this witch hunt."

### 2018: Siegal on #MeToo
Peggy Siegal, from a sailboat in Greece:
> "The Me Too crazies want blood and death."
> Called the movement **"a barbaric over reaction to behavior that just ran its course."**

### April 2018: Meier Crisis
Epstein emailed **Tom Pritzker** about architect Richard Meier (accused of harassment):
> "I assume your buddy richard meier has counsel. kathy ruemmmler has done 6 of these now for me."

This revealed Ruemmler had handled **at least six** #MeToo-related crises for Epstein's associates.

### April 2019: Legal Strategy
Epstein emailed Ruemmler:
> "bannon thinks I should hire burk and spiro to deal with civil? thoughts."

Attorney **Alex Spiro** — referred to as a **"Stone Cold Killer"** in the files — went on to represent both Harvey Weinstein and Jay-Z.

## Ruemmler as Crisis Fixer

The files paint Ruemmler as Epstein's primary legal adviser for men facing sexual misconduct allegations:
- Handled **6+ #MeToo cases** for Epstein associates
- Received **lavish gifts** including a $9,400 Hermes handbag
- Met with Epstein **dozens of times** between 2014-2019
- Listed as **backup executor** in Epstein's 2019 will
- Addressed Epstein as **"Uncle Jeffrey"** in emails
- Now serves as **Chief Legal Officer** at Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs partners expressed **unease** about Ruemmler's Epstein ties at their 2026 annual gathering.

## The Irony

The emails reveal a deeply ironic dynamic:
- Epstein — a **convicted sex offender** — was advising other accused men on how to handle accusations
- His network of lawyers actively worked to **minimize consequences** for accused perpetrators
- The same legal strategies used to protect Epstein were being deployed for others
- Epstein viewed #MeToo as making him look **"better and better"** by comparison
