# 🩺 The "Medical" Cover: Lymphatic Massage

> **Status**: **PSEUDO-MEDICAL GROOMING**

How did Epstein convince parents (and the girls themselves) that this was a job? He used a medical cover story.

## The Pitch
*   **The Concept**: Epstein claimed to be a health fanatic interested in "Lymphatic Massage."
*   **The Lie**: He told victims that massage helped "release toxins" and was a legitimate medical therapy.
*   **The Training**: He often paid for victims to go to massage school (or receive quick training from his staff) to "legitimize" the work.

## The Uniforms
*   **The Nurse Look**: Victims testified that they were sometimes asked to wear white uniforms or outfits resembling nurse/masseuse attire.
*   **The Purpose**: This created a psychological distance. It wasn't "sex"; it was a "procedure."

## 3. The Protocols (Staff Instructions)
*   **"Lie About Your Age"**: Victims testified they were explicitly instructed by recruiters (like Kellen) to say they were **18** if anyone asked, regardless of their actual age.
*   **The Cleanup**: Housekeepers were tasked with sanitizing the "massage" rooms, including wiping down vibrators and disposing of used condoms found in the trash, normalizing the sexual nature of the "medical" visits.

## The "Health" Obsession
*   **DNA**: This fit into his broader obsession with DNA and Eugenics. He viewed his body as a temple that needed constant maintenance.
*   **The "Healing"**: He convinced some victims that *he* was helping *them* by giving them a career in health/beauty.

## Significance
This veneer of "Health & Wellness" allowed him to operate in plain sight. It gave his recruiters a script: *"He's a rich guy who needs massages for his back pain. It pays $200."*
