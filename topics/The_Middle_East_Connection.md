# 🇸🇦 The Middle East Connection: Passports & Princes

> **Status**: **DOCUMENTED ATTEMPTS / MYSTERIOUS ITEMS**

Jeffrey Epstein's network wasn't limited to the West. He aggressively courted influence in the Middle East, specifically Saudi Arabia.

## 1. The Fake Passport
*   **The Discovery**: Found in the locked safe during the 2019 FBI raid.
*   **The Details**:
    *   **Photo**: Jeffrey Epstein.
    *   **Name**: A fake name.
    *   **Residence**: **Saudi Arabia**.
*   **The Question**: Why Saudi Arabia? It suggests Epstein may have viewed the Kingdom as a potential non-extradition haven or had intelligence ties there.

## 2. Mohammed bin Salman (MBS)
*   **The Claim**: Epstein told associates he knew the Saudi Crown Prince, **Mohammed bin Salman**.
*   **The Photo**: Visitors to Epstein's mansion reported seeing a framed photo of MBS on display.
*   **The Visits**: Reports indicate Epstein visited Saudi Arabia multiple times before the 2016 election.

## 3. The Tesla Privatization Attempt (2018)
*   **The Context**: Elon Musk tweeted "Funding secured" to take Tesla private, relying on the **Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF)**.
*   **Epstein's Move**: Emails reveal Epstein tried to insert himself into this deal. He claimed to be an advisor to the Saudis and offered to help Musk facilitate the transaction.
*   **Musk's Response**: Musk claims he rejected Epstein's involvement.

## 4. Adnan Khashoggi (The Arms Dealer)
*   **The Plane**: Epstein's infamous Boeing 727 ("Lolita Express") was reportedly originally owned by **Adnan Khashoggi**, the legendary Saudi arms dealer.
*   **The Connection**: This links Epstein's "hardware" directly to the world of international intelligence and arms trafficking.

## Verdict
**A Strategic Target.** Epstein clearly viewed the Middle East as a source of "whale" clients (Sovereign Wealth Funds) and a potential escape route. The passport is the strongest physical evidence of this link.
