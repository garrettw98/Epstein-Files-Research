# 🤐 The NDA: The Legal Gag

> **Status**: **VERIFIED LEGAL WEAPON**

Epstein didn't just rely on fear; he relied on contract law. The Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) was his primary shield against civil liability.

## The Terms
*   **Perpetual Silence**: Victims who received settlements (often small amounts like $10,000-$50,000 in the early days) signed agreements banning them from *ever* discussing their employment or interactions with Epstein.
*   **The Scope**: The NDAs often covered not just Epstein, but "associates, guests, and employees," effectively shielding the entire network.
*   **The Penalty**: The threat of being sued for "breach of contract" kept poor victims silent for decades.

## The "Co-Conspirator" Clause
*   **The 2008 NPA**: The Non-Prosecution Agreement was essentially a "Super NDA" signed by the US Government. It silenced the *prosecutors* from going after the accomplices.

## Significance
These contracts weaponized the legal system against the victims. It wasn't until the **Trafficking Victims Protection Act** and similar laws allowed courts to void these "contracts of adhesion" that the truth began to come out.
