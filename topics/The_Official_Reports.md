# 📑 The Official Reports: Institutional Confessions

> **Status**: **VERIFIED INTERNAL ADMISSIONS**

After Epstein's arrest in 2019, the institutions that enabled him were forced to investigate themselves. These reports provide the definitive proof of institutional failure.

## 1. The MIT Fact-Finding Report (2020)
*   **The Findings**: The report confirmed that **Joi Ito** (Media Lab Director) and his staff created a system to accept Epstein's money while keeping it anonymous to avoid public scrutiny.
*   **The "Whitelisting"**: Despite Epstein being marked as "Disqualified" in the donor database, senior staff manually overrode the blocks to accept the cash.
*   **The Quote**: Staff referred to Epstein as "Voldemort" (he who must not be named) in internal emails, proving they knew it was wrong.

## 2. The Harvard Review (2020)
*   **The Findings**: Epstein donated **$9.1 million** to Harvard between 1998 and 2008.
*   **The Access**: Even *after* his 2008 sex conviction, Epstein was given:
    *   A dedicated office in the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics.
    *   A Harvard phone line.
    *   A key card for unrestricted access to campus buildings.
*   **The "Fellow" Myth**: Epstein claimed to be a "Visiting Fellow," a title Harvard eventually revoked/denied, but they allowed him to act like one for years.

## 3. The DOJ OPR Report (2020)
*   **Subject**: The conduct of **Alexander Acosta** and the prosecutors who signed the 2008 Plea Deal.
*   **The Findings**:
    *   The report criticized the prosecutors for "poor judgment" and being "outmaneuvered" by Epstein's defense team.
    *   **The Verdict**: It stopped short of finding "professional misconduct," which would have disbarred them.
    *   **Victim Notification**: It admitted the failure to notify victims violated the *spirit* of the law, even if they argued technicalities on the letter of the law.

## 4. The DOJ OIG Report (2023)
*   **Subject**: The death of Jeffrey Epstein.
*   **The Findings**: Confirmed the "perfect storm" of failures at the MCC jail.
    *   Sleeping guards.
    *   Broken cameras.
    *   Failure to assign a new cellmate.
*   **Conclusion**: Attributed the death to "negligence and misconduct" by BOP staff, rather than a criminal conspiracy, though it documented the suspicious circumstances extensively.
