# 📉 The Origin Story: Towers Financial & The Ponzi Scheme

> **Status**: **HISTORICAL FRAUD** (Steven Hoffenberg Testimony)

The biggest mystery of the Epstein case is: **"Where did the money come from?"**
Epstein didn't have typical Wall Street clients. The answer likely lies in the 1980s and a man named **Steven Hoffenberg**.

## The Mentor: Steven Hoffenberg
*   **Who was he?**: The CEO of **Towers Financial Corporation**, a debt collection agency.
*   **The Hiring**: In 1987, he hired Jeffrey Epstein (who had just left Bear Stearns).
*   **The Job**: Epstein became a high-level consultant/fixer for Towers.

## The Ponzi Scheme
Towers Financial turned out to be a massive **$450 million Ponzi scheme**.
*   **The Collapse**: It imploded in 1993.
*   **The Fallout**: Hoffenberg was arrested and sentenced to **20 years in prison**.
*   **The Escape**: Jeffrey Epstein was **never charged**.

## The "Unindicted Co-Conspirator"
Years later, after getting out of prison, Hoffenberg claimed that Epstein wasn't just an employee—he was the **"architect"** of the scam.
*   **The Claim**: Hoffenberg asserted that Epstein manipulated the financial books and helped move the stolen money.
*   **The "Exit"**: Hoffenberg claimed Epstein left Towers just before the collapse, taking millions of dollars in stolen funds with him.
*   **The Seed Money**: This stolen cash is theorized to be the "seed money" Epstein used to start his own firm ("J. Epstein & Co.") and reinvent himself as a legitimate billionaire money manager for Les Wexner.

## Hoffenberg's Death (2022)
*   **The Discovery**: In August 2022, Hoffenberg's decomposing body was found in his Connecticut apartment.
*   **Cause**: Police stated there were no initial signs of trauma, but the timing (shortly after Ghislaine Maxwell's sentencing) fueled online speculation.
*   **Legacy**: He was the only person who publicly testified to the criminal origins of Epstein's wealth.
