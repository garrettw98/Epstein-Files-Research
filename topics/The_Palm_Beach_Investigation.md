# 🌴 The Palm Beach War: Police vs. Prosecutors (2005-2006)

> **Status**: **VERIFIED OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE**

Before the FBI or Alexander Acosta got involved, there was a local battle for justice. It pitted an honest police department against a State Attorney determined to let Epstein walk.

## The Hero: Chief Michael Reiter
**Michael Reiter** was the Chief of Police in Palm Beach.
*   **The Investigation**: In 2005, after a parent complained, Reiter launched "Operation 12-20."
*   **The Evidence**: His detectives raided Epstein's trash (finding notes from girls) and interviewed dozens of victims.
*   **The Conclusion**: Reiter's team recommended charging Epstein with **kidnapping, sexual battery, and multiple felonies**. They had a solid case for a **life sentence**.

## The Villain: Barry Krischer (State Attorney)
**Barry Krischer** was the State Attorney for Palm Beach County.
*   **The Obstruction**: Instead of filing the charges Reiter recommended, Krischer actively blocked the police.
*   **The Grand Jury Sham**: Krischer presented a watered-down case to a grand jury, calling only *one* victim and attacking her credibility.
*   **The Pivot**: He pushed to charge Epstein only with "solicitation of prostitution" (a misdemeanor), framing the child victims as "prostitutes."

## The "Trash" Pull
*   **The Evidence**: Police found messages in Epstein's trash cans written by girls asking for help or money.
*   **Significance**: This physical evidence corroborated the victim stories, but prosecutors ignored it.

## The Result
Because Krischer refused to prosecute the serious crimes, the case eventually moved to the Feds (Acosta), who *also* failed. But the failure started locally.
