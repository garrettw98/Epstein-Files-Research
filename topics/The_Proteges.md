# 🎓 The Protégés: Epstein as "Mentor"

> **Status**: **PSYCHOLOGICAL PATTERN**

Jeffrey Epstein didn't just want money; he wanted to be the "wise old man" behind the throne. He aggressively courted younger, powerful men, trying to position himself as their indispensible advisor.

## 1. Jes Staley (The Banker)
*   **The Dynamic**: Staley was a successful executive at JPMorgan, yet he deferred to Epstein.
*   **The Evidence**: 1,200 emails show a relationship that went far beyond business. They shared personal photos, philosophical musings, and coded language ("Snow White"). Staley visited Epstein in prison and called him a "brother."

## 2. Mohammed bin Salman (The Prince)
*   **The Target**: MBS was the young, reformer Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.
*   **The Pitch**: Epstein tried to position himself as the bridge between MBS and Western finance.
*   **The Artifact**: Epstein kept a photo of MBS in his mansion to show visitors, implying, "I am guiding the future King."

## 3. Elon Musk (The Titan)
*   **The Attempt**: Epstein tried to insert himself into the 2018 "Tesla Privatization" deal.
*   **The Pitch**: He offered to be the architect of the deal with the Saudis.
*   **The Rejection**: Musk claims he sensed something was off and rejected the overtures, but Epstein's intent was clear: to "own" the next generation's biggest genius.

## 4. The "Science" Kids
*   **The Strategy**: Epstein funded young Ph.D. students and researchers at MIT and Harvard.
*   **The Hook**: He offered them funding that traditional grants wouldn't, buying their loyalty and admiration early in their careers.

## The Psychology
Epstein likely saw himself as a "Kingmaker." By mentoring these men, he felt powerful by proxy. It was another form of control—intellectual rather than sexual.
