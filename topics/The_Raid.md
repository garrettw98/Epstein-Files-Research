# 🔓 The Raid: What Was in the Safe?

> **Date**: July 6, 2019 (Search Warrant Executed)
> **Location**: **9 East 71st Street, New York** (The Main Mansion)

When the FBI raided Epstein's primary Manhattan residence (not the stash houses), they broke into a heavy steel safe. The contents painted a picture of a man prepared to flee at a moment's notice.

## 1. The Fake Passports
*   **The Item**: An expired foreign passport (issued in the 1980s) with Epstein's photo but a **different name**.
*   **Residence**: The passport listed his residence as **Saudi Arabia**.
*   **Significance**: Possession of a fake passport is a serious federal crime and suggests he had "exit strategies" in place for decades. Epstein's lawyers claimed it was for "personal protection" against kidnappers (a common defense for high-net-worth individuals), but the fake name suggests deception.

## 2. Loose Diamonds
*   **Inventory**: Dozens of loose diamonds (some reports say 48 diamonds).
*   **Significance**: Diamonds are a "portable wealth" favored by money launderers and fugitives because they are untraceable, high-value, and do not trigger metal detectors like gold.

## 3. The Cash
*   **Amount**: Roughly **$70,000** in US currency.
*   **Significance**: "Go-bag" money. Enough to charter a private flight or live off the grid for months.

## 4. The "CDs" and Hard Drives
*   **The Labels**: Several CDs were found with handwritten labels.
*   **Viral Detail**: One label reportedly read **"Young [Name] + [Name]"**.
*   **The Contents**: The DOJ has confirmed these contained "images," but has never publicly released the full content of these specific discs. It is widely believed these are part of the "kompromat" or personal collection mentioned in [The Tapes](The_Tapes.md).

## 5. "The Painting" (Pet Bill Clinton)
*   **The Item**: While not in the safe, agents found a bizarre oil painting hanging in the mansion.
*   **Description**: It depicted **Bill Clinton** wearing a blue dress (resembling Monica Lewinsky's famous dress) and red heels, lounging in the Oval Office.
*   **Significance**: This went viral as proof of Epstein's bizarre, mocking relationship with the powerful men he collected.
