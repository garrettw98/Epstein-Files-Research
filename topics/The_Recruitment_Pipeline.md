# 👠 The Recruitment Pipeline: "Modeling" as a Trap

> **Status**: **VERIFIED** (Jean-Luc Brunel Indictment)

Epstein didn't just pick up girls at the mall. He industrialized the recruitment process using the legitimate fashion industry as a front.

## 1. MC2 Model Management (Jean-Luc Brunel)
*   **The Founder**: **Jean-Luc Brunel**, a titan of the modeling world.
*   **The Scheme**: MC2 was a legitimate agency, but it had a "dark side." Brunel would scout young girls from poor backgrounds in Eastern Europe and South America.
*   **The "Visa" Trap**: He would promise them US work visas. Once they arrived, they were housed in apartments owned by Epstein (like 301 East 66th St).
*   **The Debt**: The girls were told they owed money for travel/rent. They were then "offered" extra cash to give "massages" to Epstein to pay off the debt.

## 2. Karin Models
*   **The Connection**: Another agency Brunel was associated with.
*   **The Funding**: Epstein invested **$1 million** into MC2, effectively buying his own supply line of vulnerable women.

## 3. The "Scouts"
Aside from professional agents, Epstein used his own victims as recruiters (The Pyramid Scheme).
*   **Sarah Kellen**: Would act as a "booker."
*   **The "Target" Demographic**: Epstein preferred girls who were financially desperate or from broken homes, making them less likely to go to the police.

## 4. The "Victoria's Secret" Connection (Les Wexner)
*   **The Access**: Because Epstein managed Les Wexner's money (owner of Victoria's Secret), he posed as a talent scout for the brand.
*   **The Lie**: He would approach girls telling them he could get them into the VS catalog.
*   **Wexner's Response**: Wexner claims he banned Epstein from using his name after he found out about this in the 90s, but the association persisted.
