# 👠 The Recruitment Pipeline: "Modeling" as a Trap

> **Status**: **VERIFIED** (Jean-Luc Brunel Indictment)

Epstein didn't just pick up girls at the mall. He industrialized the recruitment process using the legitimate fashion industry as a front.

## 1. MC2 Model Management (Jean-Luc Brunel)
*   **The Founder**: **Jean-Luc Brunel**, a titan of the modeling world.
*   **The Scheme**: MC2 was a legitimate agency, but it had a "dark side." Brunel would scout young girls from poor backgrounds in Eastern Europe (Ukraine) and **South America (Brazil)**.
*   **The "Visa" Trap**: He would promise them US work visas. Once they arrived, they were housed in apartments owned by Epstein (like 301 East 66th St).
*   **The Debt**: The girls were told they owed money for travel/rent. They were then "offered" extra cash to give "massages" to Epstein to pay off the debt.
*   **2026 Update**: New emails reveal direct correspondence between Brunel and **Ukrainian modeling agencies**, with Epstein cc'd on the potential recruits.
    *   *The Financing*: Internal accounting documents confirmed Epstein provided a **$1 million line of credit** to MC2, proving he was the financier behind the entire operation, not just a client.

## 2. Karin Models
*   **The Connection**: Another agency Brunel was associated with.
*   **The Funding**: Epstein invested **$1 million** into MC2, effectively buying his own supply line of vulnerable women.

## 3. The "Scouts"
Aside from professional agents, Epstein used his own victims as recruiters (The Pyramid Scheme).
*   **Sarah Kellen**: Would act as a "booker."
*   **The "Target" Demographic**: Epstein preferred girls who were financially desperate or from broken homes, making them less likely to go to the police.

## 4. The "Victoria's Secret" Connection (Les Wexner)
*   **The Access**: Because Epstein managed Les Wexner's money (owner of Victoria's Secret), he posed as a talent scout for the brand.
*   **The Lie**: He would approach girls telling them he could get them into the VS catalog.
*   **Wexner's Response**: Wexner claims he banned Epstein from using his name after he found out about this in the 90s, but the association persisted.

## 5. The College Admissions & Visa Fraud
Epstein didn't just recruit models; he recruited students and immigrants.
*   **The "Babysitter" Lure**: He recruited women for "nanny" or "babysitting" jobs, despite having no children. This was a cover to get them into his homes.
*   **Green Card Marriages**: To keep his foreign victims in the US, he arranged (and paid for) sham marriages between the women and his male associates.
*   **The College Bribe**: He used his influence to help the children of associates get into elite colleges.
    *   *Example*: He helped **Woody Allen's** daughter get into **Bard College** by leveraging his donations to President Leon Botstein.
    *   *The Hook*: This created a debt of gratitude from powerful parents.
