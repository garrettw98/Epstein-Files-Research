# The Secure Reading Room Protocol

> **Status**: **DOCUMENTED ACCESS PROCESS**

## Summary

On February 9, 2026, DOJ opened a secure review process for members of Congress to examine unredacted Epstein-file materials with advance notice requirements. This protocol became the center of later disputes over what was visible to lawmakers versus what was publicly released.

## Reported Protocol Elements

- Congressional member access with advance notice.
- Secure-room review environment rather than broad public release.
- Distinction between unredacted review copies and public-facing versions.

## Why This Matters

- It created a two-track disclosure system (public vs secure review).
- It enabled lawmakers to challenge public redaction choices based on direct comparison.
- It introduced governance questions about parity, auditability, and oversight transparency.

## Process Risks

1. **Comparability risk**: Difficult to track exact delta between secure and public versions without structured diff logs.
2. **Attribution risk**: Public statements may outpace documentary release of the referenced pages.
3. **Governance risk**: Secure access can improve oversight but also concentrates interpretive power.

## What Is Documented vs Unresolved

### Documented
- AP reported secure-room congressional access began Feb 9, 2026.
- Lawmakers publicly said secure-room review revealed notable redaction differences.

### Unresolved
- Full protocol document (retention, monitoring, audit trails) in primary-doc artifacts.
- Standardized process for public release reconciliation after secure-room findings.
