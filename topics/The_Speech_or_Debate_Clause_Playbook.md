# The Speech or Debate Clause Playbook

> **Status**: **CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURAL TOOL (AS USED IN 2026 DISCLOSURES)**

## Summary

During the February 2026 disclosure conflict, lawmakers used floor speech protections to publicly name individuals that had appeared redacted in broader public release files. This topic tracks how that mechanism was used and what limits still apply.

## Core Mechanism

The U.S. Constitution's Speech or Debate protections shield members of Congress from liability for legislative acts, including statements made on the floor as part of official proceedings.

In this case, lawmakers used that protection to disclose names after reviewing unredacted materials.

## Why It Matters in This Repo

- It changed the release timeline by moving selected disclosures from executive control to legislative speech.
- It created a legal pathway for disclosure pressure outside DOJ redaction gates.
- It increases need for strict evidence labeling because legal privilege is not equivalent to factual adjudication.

## Limits and Caveats

- Clause protection affects liability for the speaker; it does not automatically validate factual claims.
- Floor disclosures can still require independent corroboration for repository claim upgrades.
- Reputational and legal impacts for named non-parties remain significant even when disclosures are constitutionally protected.
