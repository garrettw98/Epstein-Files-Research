# 📋 The Staff Rulebook: Bizarre Protocols & "Vibe Control"

> **Status**: **VERIFIED TESTIMONY** (2026 Release)

Working for Jeffrey Epstein wasn't just about cleaning a house; it was about maintaining a tightly controlled, paranoid environment. The 2026 release of employee handbooks and testimony reveals the specific, bizarre rules staff had to follow.

## 1. The Bedside Setup
*   **The Gun**: A handgun was required to be placed in the bedside table at all times.
*   **The Money**: Staff had to fan out **$100 bills** near the bed (purpose unclear, possibly for tipping/paying victims immediately).
*   **The Temperature**: The air conditioning had to be set to exactly **60°F (15.5°C)**.
*   **The Toiletries**: Toothpaste and tissue boxes had to be filled to specific levels.

## 2. The "No Eye Contact" Rule
*   **The Instruction**: **Ghislaine Maxwell** strictly enforced a rule that "invisible" staff (cleaners, maintenance) were **forbidden from making eye contact** with Epstein or his guests.
*   **The Punishment**: Violation of these "vibe" rules could lead to immediate termination.

## 3. The Car Protocol
Every car in the fleet had to be ready for an immediate getaway or trip.
*   **The Gas**: Tanks had to be at least **3/4 full** at all times.
*   **The Glove Box**: Must contain exactly **$100 in cash**.
*   **The Water**: Two bottles of water, fresh.

## 4. The "Cleanup" Crew
The housekeeping staff were involuntary witnesses to the aftermath of the abuse.
*   **The Vibrators**: Maids testified to having to wipe down sex toys found in the massage rooms.
*   **The Towels**: Massive amounts of laundry were generated daily from the "massage" sessions.
*   **The Denial**: Staff were trained to never ask questions about what happened in those rooms.

## Significance
These rules paint a picture of a man who was deeply paranoid (the gun, the car cash), obsessed with control (the temperature, the toothpaste), and who structured his entire household to facilitate and clean up after his crimes.
