# 🏢 The "Stash Houses": 301 East 66th Street

> **Status**: **VERIFIED TRAFFICKING LOCATIONS**

Epstein's mansion on 71st Street was the headquarters, but the "barracks" for his operation were elsewhere.

## 1. 301 East 66th Street (The Dormitory)
*   **The Building**: A massive luxury high-rise on the Upper East Side.
*   **The Holdings**: Epstein's brother Mark owned units, and Jeffrey used them. Specifically, **Unit 10F** was linked to his shell companies.
*   **The Purpose**:
    *   **Housing Models**: This building functioned as a dormitory for the young women recruited by **Jean-Luc Brunel**.
    *   **Separation**: By keeping them here, Epstein separated his "inventory" from his "headquarters" (the 71st St Mansion), reducing the risk of high-profile guests seeing the sheer volume of women.
    *   **Control**: The women were often told they owed rent for these apartments, creating a debt bondage.

## 2. The "MC2" Dorms
*   **The Setup**: Victims described living in these apartments with other "models."
*   **The Debt**: They were often told they owed rent, which could be "worked off" by providing massages to Epstein at the mansion.
*   **The Pipeline**: This building was the physical manifestation of the "Visa to Victim" pipeline.

## 3. The Palm Beach Staff House
*   **Location**: A house near the main Palm Beach estate.
*   **Use**: Housed staff and "assistants" (often recruiters like Sarah Kellen or victims being groomed).

## Significance
These properties prove the industrial scale of the operation. He wasn't just bringing girls home; he was warehousing them in corporate housing.
