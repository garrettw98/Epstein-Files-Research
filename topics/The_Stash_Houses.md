# 🏢 The "Stash Houses": 301 East 66th Street

> **Status**: **VERIFIED TRAFFICKING LOCATIONS**

Epstein's mansion on 71st Street was the headquarters, but the "barracks" for his operation were elsewhere.

## 1. 301 East 66th Street
*   **The Building**: A massive luxury high-rise on the Upper East Side.
*   **The Holdings**: Epstein (or shell companies linked to him) owned nearly **20 apartments** in this single building.
*   **The Purpose**:
    *   **Housing Models**: This is where the young women recruited by **Jean-Luc Brunel** and MC2 Models were housed.
    *   **Control**: By controlling their housing, Epstein ensured the women were dependent on him.
    *   **Segregation**: It kept the "volume" of women away from the main mansion, where he hosted high-profile guests like Bill Gates or Prince Andrew.

## 2. The "MC2" Dorms
*   **The Setup**: Victims described living in these apartments with other "models."
*   **The Debt**: They were often told they owed rent, which could be "worked off" by providing massages to Epstein at the mansion.
*   **The Pipeline**: This building was the physical manifestation of the "Visa to Victim" pipeline.

## 3. The Palm Beach Staff House
*   **Location**: A house near the main Palm Beach estate.
*   **Use**: Housed staff and "assistants" (often recruiters like Sarah Kellen or victims being groomed).

## Significance
These properties prove the industrial scale of the operation. He wasn't just bringing girls home; he was warehousing them in corporate housing.
