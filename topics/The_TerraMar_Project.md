# 🌊 The TerraMar Project: Ghislaine's UN Front

> **Status**: **DEFUNCT CHARITY / SUSPECTED DIPLOMATIC COVER**

While Jeffrey Epstein used "Science" to launder his reputation, Ghislaine Maxwell used "The Oceans."

## The Charity
*   **Founded**: 2012 (by Ghislaine Maxwell).
*   **Mission**: "To create a global community for the high seas."
*   **The Pitch**: The "High Seas" (international waters) belong to no one. Maxwell argued they should be a "global commons."

## The United Nations Connection
*   **Access**: Through TerraMar, Maxwell spoke at the **United Nations** multiple times.
*   **The Image**: She rebranded herself as an "Ocean Philanthropist," scrubbing the "Socialite/Madam" image.
*   **The Funding**: TerraMar raised very little money from the public. It was funded almost entirely by... Ghislaine Maxwell (and likely Epstein).

## The "Sovereign Immunity" Theory
Experts and researchers have theorized that TerraMar was more than a vanity project.
*   **The Goal**: To create a new "Citizenship of the High Seas."
*   **The Passport**: If TerraMar could get recognized as a sovereign entity (like the Knights of Malta or a micronation), it could issue **Diplomatic Passports**.
*   **The Immunity**: A diplomatic passport offers immunity from prosecution in many jurisdictions.
*   **Submarines**: Epstein and Maxwell were obsessed with submarines (which they owned). International waters + Diplomatic Immunity = The perfect escape.

## The End
*   **The Shutdown**: TerraMar announced it was shutting down on **July 12, 2019**—exactly **6 days after Jeffrey Epstein was arrested**.
*   **Significance**: The timing suggests the "front" was no longer useful (or safe) once the primary financier was in custody.
