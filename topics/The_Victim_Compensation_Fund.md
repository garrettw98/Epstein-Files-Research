# 💰 The Victim Compensation Program

> **Status**: **CLOSED / DISTRIBUTED**

After Epstein's death, the Estate established a voluntary program to compensate victims without forcing them to go through painful public trials.

## The Numbers
*   **Total Paid**: Approximately **$150 million**.
*   **Claimants**: Roughly **135 individuals** received compensation.
*   **Average Payout**: ~$1.1 million (though amounts varied significantly based on the severity of abuse).

## The Controversy: "The Release"
*   **The Catch**: To accept the money, victims had to sign a legal release.
*   **The Terms**: This release prevented them from suing the Epstein Estate.
*   **The Debate**: Critics argued this was a final way for the Estate (run by Indyke and Kahn) to buy silence and prevent further discovery that might implicate other enablers.

## The Administrator: Jordana Feldman
*   **Role**: An independent administrator appointed to run the fund.
*   **Legacy**: While the fund provided financial relief to many who would otherwise have gotten nothing, it also effectively closed the book on civil litigation against the Estate itself.

## Significance
This program is the reason we haven't seen 135 separate lawsuits. It provided justice for the victims, but it also provided "closure" for the Estate.
