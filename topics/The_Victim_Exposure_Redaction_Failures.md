# Victim Exposure Redaction Failures

> **Status**: **DOCUMENTED PRIVACY-HARM DISPUTE**

## Summary

Release-era publication was criticized for exposing victim-identifying details while some perpetrator-context records remained contested or redacted. This topic tracks the privacy-harm side of the release process.

## Core Issues

- Exposure of victim-linked identifiers in released materials.
- Debate over redaction priority and quality control.
- Tension between transparency demands and survivor protection obligations.

## Why This Matters

- Privacy failures can cause direct survivor harm.
- Process legitimacy is reduced when redaction errors affect vulnerable parties.
- Any future release protocol needs a survivor-safety-first QA layer.

## Documented vs Unresolved

### Documented
- Victim-protection failures were reported and became a central legal and political issue.
- Attorneys representing survivors sought emergency intervention after publication.

### Unresolved
- Full count and scope of exposure events by dataset.
- Remediation audit trail showing what was corrected, when, and how fully.

## Repository Research Rules

- Do not reproduce sensitive personal identifiers.
- Keep survivor references anonymized unless already formally public and necessary.
- Treat privacy remediation status as an open process metric, not a one-time event.
