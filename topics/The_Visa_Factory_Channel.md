# The Visa Factory Channel

> **Status**: **DOCUMENTED RED-FLAG CHANNEL / FULL ATTRIBUTION INCOMPLETE**

## Summary

This topic tracks the reported use of visa pathways to move young women into U.S. jurisdictions linked to Epstein/Brunel operations. It converts a recurring "missing link" thread into a structured channel analysis.

## Channel Model

1. Repeated visa applications under high-scrutiny categories.
2. Recurrent addresses, sponsors, and recruiter links.
3. Weak or inconsistent portfolio support in portions of reported cases.
4. Limited publicly resolved attribution for approving officials.

## Why It Matters

- Visa process can function as a logistics layer in recruitment/transport systems.
- Identifies institutional points where intervention could have occurred.

## Evidence Posture

### Documented
- Repository files describe recurring visa-red-flag concerns tied to Brunel-linked modeling pathways.

### Unresolved
- Full official-level decision chain for approvals and overrides.
- Publicly available disciplinary/accountability records for processing failures.
