# 🛸 Weird & Unverified FBI Tips

> **Status**: **RAW INTELLIGENCE / UNVERIFIED**

The 2026 release included thousands of pages of "FBI Tips"—reports called in by the public or informants. **These are NOT verified facts.** They are just logs of what people *told* the FBI.

## The "Human Sacrifice" Tip
*   **The Tip**: An anonymous informant called the FBI claiming to have witnessed "ceremonial" activities at Zorro Ranch (New Mexico) involving "human sacrifice."
*   **The Reality**: The FBI investigated Zorro Ranch. They found:
    *   No remains.
    *   No evidence of murder.
    *   **Verified**: They *did* find a bizarre temple-like structure and plans for a "baby breeding" facility (genetic improvement), but no evidence of ritual killing.
*   **Assessment**: Likely an exaggeration of the confirmed "eugenics/breeding" fantasies Epstein held.

## The "Cryogenics" Tip
*   **The Tip**: Epstein planned to have his head and penis frozen after death to be resurrected.
*   **The Reality**: Epstein was obsessed with "transhumanism" and funded scientists working on life extension. He *did* express interest in cryonics to associates, but there is no evidence this was carried out.

## Why Include These?
Internet conspiracy theories often take these raw "tips" and present them as "FBI Confirmations." It is crucial to distinguish between:
1.  **A Tip**: "Someone *told* the FBI X happened."
2.  **A Finding**: "The FBI *confirmed* X happened."

**These are purely Tips.**
