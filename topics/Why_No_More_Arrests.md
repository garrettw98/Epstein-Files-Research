# 👮 Why Are There No More Arrests?

> **Status**: **THE PUBLIC'S GREATEST FRUSTRATION**

Millions of pages of documents, yet only Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison. Why?

## 1. The "Statute of Limitations"
*   **The Problem**: Many of the crimes took place between **2002 and 2005**.
*   **The Law**: For many sex crimes (especially state charges), the window to prosecute closes after 5-10 years.
*   **Federal Exception**: While federal sex trafficking has no statute of limitations (thanks to new laws), applying them retroactively to conduct from 2002 is legally complex.

## 2. The Death of the "Hub"
*   **The Problem**: Jeffrey Epstein is dead.
*   **The Consequence**: In a conspiracy case, you typically flip the leader to testify against the "Johns." Without Epstein to say, "Yes, Prince Andrew knew she was underage," it becomes a "He said / She said" case.
*   **Burden of Proof**: Proving a powerful man *knew* a 17-year-old was a trafficking victim (vs. a consenting adult, as they often claim) is difficult without the trafficker's testimony.

## 3. The 2008 Immunity Deal (Still Haunting)
*   **The NPA**: The Non-Prosecution Agreement signed by Acosta gave immunity to "any potential co-conspirators."
*   **The Debate**: While a judge ruled it was illegal regarding the *victims*, defense lawyers for people like Sarah Kellen still argue it protects them from federal prosecution for crimes committed during that period.

## 4. The "John Doe" Problem
*   **Redactions**: Many names in the files are still "John Doe."
*   **Privacy**: Courts struggle to balance the public's right to know with the privacy of individuals who may have been witnesses or non-sexual associates.

## 5. The "Rich Man's Justice"
*   **Defense Teams**: The suspects (Dubin, Wexner, Black) have limitless resources. They can drag out investigations for decades.
*   **Settlements**: Many accused men (like Prince Andrew) settle *civil* cases with money to avoid the risk of a *criminal* trial.
